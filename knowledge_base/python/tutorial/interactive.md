# Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution {#tut-interacting}

Some versions of the Python interpreter support editing of the current
input line and history substitution, similar to facilities found in the
Korn shell and the GNU Bash shell. This is implemented using the [GNU
Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) library,
which supports various styles of editing. This library has its own
documentation which we won\'t duplicate here.

## Tab Completion and History Editing {#tut-keybindings}

Completion of variable and module names is
`automatically enabled <rlcompleter-config>` at interpreter startup so that the `Tab` key invokes the completion function; it looks at Python
statement names, the current local variables, and the available module
names. For dotted expressions such as `string.a`, it will evaluate the
expression up to the final `'.'` and then suggest completions from the
attributes of the resulting object. Note that this may execute
application-defined code if an object with a
`~object.__getattr__` method is part of
the expression. The default configuration also saves your history into a
file named `.python_history` in your user
directory. The history will be available again during the next
interactive interpreter session.

## Alternatives to the Interactive Interpreter {#tut-commentary}

This facility is an enormous step forward compared to earlier versions
of the interpreter; however, some wishes are left: It would be nice if
the proper indentation were suggested on continuation lines (the parser
knows if an `~token.INDENT` token is
required next). The completion mechanism might use the interpreter\'s
symbol table. A command to check (or even suggest) matching parentheses,
quotes, etc., would also be useful.

One alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around
for quite some time is [IPython](https://ipython.org/), which features
tab completion, object exploration and advanced history management. It
can also be thoroughly customized and embedded into other applications.
Another similar enhanced interactive environment is
[bpython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/).
