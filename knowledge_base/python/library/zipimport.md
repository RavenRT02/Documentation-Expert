# `!zipimport` \-\-- Import modules from Zip archives

::: {.module synopsis="Support for importing Python modules from ZIP archives."}
zipimport
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/zipimport.py`

This module adds the ability to import Python modules
(`\*.py`, `\*.pyc`) and packages from ZIP-format archives. It is usually not
needed to use the `!zipimport` module
explicitly; it is automatically used by the built-in
`import` mechanism for
`sys.path` items that are paths to ZIP
archives.

Typically, `sys.path` is a list of
directory names as strings. This module also allows an item of
`sys.path` to be a string naming a ZIP
file archive. The ZIP archive can contain a subdirectory structure to
support package imports, and a path within the archive can be specified
to only import from a subdirectory. For example, the path
`example.zip/lib/` would only import from
the `lib/` subdirectory within the
archive.

Any files may be present in the ZIP archive, but importers are only
invoked for `.py` and
`.pyc` files. ZIP import of dynamic
modules (`.pyd`, `.so`) is disallowed. Note that if an archive only contains
`.py` files, Python will not attempt to
modify the archive by adding the corresponding `.pyc` file, meaning that if a ZIP archive doesn\'t contain
`.pyc` files, importing may be rather
slow.

`273` - Import Modules from Zip Archives

: Written by James C. Ahlstrom, who also provided an implementation.
  Python 2.3 follows the specification in `273`, but uses an implementation written by Just van Rossum
  that uses the import hooks described in `302`.

: Package providing the relevant protocols for all importers to
  implement.

This module defines an exception:

::: exception
ZipImportError

Exception raised by zipimporter objects. It\'s a subclass of
`ImportError`, so it can be caught as
`ImportError`, too.
:::

## zipimporter Objects

`zipimporter` is the class for importing
ZIP files.

::::::::::::::::::::: zipimporter(archivepath)
Create a new zipimporter instance. *archivepath* must be a path to a ZIP
file, or to a specific path within a ZIP file. For example, an
*archivepath* of `foo/bar.zip/lib` will
look for modules in the `lib` directory
inside the ZIP file `foo/bar.zip`
(provided that it exists).

`ZipImportError` is raised if
*archivepath* doesn\'t point to a valid ZIP archive.

::: versionchanged
3.12

Methods `find_loader()` and `find_module()`, deprecated in 3.10 are now
removed. Use `find_spec` instead.
:::

:::: method
create_module(spec)

Implementation of `importlib.abc.Loader.create_module` that returns `None` to
explicitly request the default semantics.

::: versionadded
3.10
:::
::::

:::: method
exec_module(module)

Implementation of `importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module`.

::: versionadded
3.10
:::
::::

:::: method
find_spec(fullname, target=None)

An implementation of
`importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.find_spec`.

::: versionadded
3.10
:::
::::

::: method
get_code(fullname)

Return the code object for the specified module. Raise
`ZipImportError` if the module couldn\'t
be imported.
:::

:::: method
get_data(pathname)

Return the data associated with *pathname*. Raise
`OSError` if the file wasn\'t found.

::: versionchanged
3.3 `IOError` used to be raised, it is now
an alias of `OSError`.
:::
::::

:::: method
get_filename(fullname)

Return the value `__file__` would be set to if the specified module was
imported. Raise `ZipImportError` if the
module couldn\'t be imported.

::: versionadded
3.1
:::
::::

::: method
get_source(fullname)

Return the source code for the specified module. Raise
`ZipImportError` if the module couldn\'t
be found, return `None` if the archive
does contain the module, but has no source for it.
:::

::: method
is_package(fullname)

Return `True` if the module specified by *fullname* is a package. Raise
`ZipImportError` if the module couldn\'t
be found.
:::

:::: method
invalidate_caches()

Clear out the internal cache of information about files found within the
ZIP archive.

::: versionadded
3.10
:::
::::

::: attribute
archive

The file name of the importer\'s associated ZIP file, without a possible
subpath.
:::

::: attribute
prefix

The subpath within the ZIP file where modules are searched. This is the
empty string for zipimporter objects which point to the root of the ZIP
file.
:::

The `archive` and
`prefix` attributes, when combined with a
slash, equal the original *archivepath* argument given to the
`zipimporter` constructor.
:::::::::::::::::::::

## Examples {#zipimport-examples}

Here is an example that imports a module from a ZIP archive - note that
the `!zipimport` module is not explicitly
used.

``` shell-session
$ unzip -l example_archive.zip
Archive:  example_archive.zip
  Length     Date   Time    Name
 --------    ----   ----    ----
     8467  01-01-00 12:30   example.py
 --------                   -------
     8467                   1 file
```

``` pycon
>>> import sys
>>> # Add the archive to the front of the module search path
>>> sys.path.insert(0, 'example_archive.zip')
>>> import example
>>> example.__file__
'example_archive.zip/example.py'
```
