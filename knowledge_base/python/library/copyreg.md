# `!copyreg` \-\-- Register `!pickle` support functions

::: {.module synopsis="Register pickle support functions."}
copyreg
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/copyreg.py`

The `!copyreg` module offers a way to
define functions used while pickling specific objects. The
`pickle` and `copy` modules use those functions when pickling/copying those
objects. The module provides configuration information about object
constructors which are not classes. Such constructors may be factory
functions or class instances.

::: function
constructor(object)

Declares *object* to be a valid constructor. If *object* is not callable
(and hence not valid as a constructor), raises
`TypeError`.
:::

::: function
pickle(type, function, constructor_ob=None)

Declares that *function* should be used as a \"reduction\" function for
objects of type *type*. *function* must return either a string or a
tuple containing between two and six elements. See the
`~pickle.Pickler.dispatch_table` for more
details on the interface of *function*.

The *constructor_ob* parameter is a legacy feature and is now ignored,
but if passed it must be a callable.

Note that the `~pickle.Pickler.dispatch_table` attribute of a pickler object or subclass of
`pickle.Pickler` can also be used for
declaring reduction functions.

## Example

The example below would like to show how to register a pickle function
and how it will be used:

> \>\>\> import copyreg, copy, pickle \>\>\> class C: \... def
> \_\_init\_\_(self, a): \... self.a = a \... \>\>\> def pickle_c(c):
> \... print(\"pickling a C instance\...\") \... return C, (c.a,) \...
> \>\>\> copyreg.pickle(C, pickle_c) \>\>\> c = C(1) \>\>\> d =
> copy.copy(c) \# doctest: +SKIP pickling a C instance\... \>\>\> p =
> pickle.dumps(c) \# doctest: +SKIP pickling a C instance\...
