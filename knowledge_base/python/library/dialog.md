# Tkinter dialogs

## `!tkinter.simpledialog` \-\-- Standard Tkinter input dialogs

::: {.module synopsis="Simple dialog windows"}
tkinter.simpledialog
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/tkinter/simpledialog.py`

The `!tkinter.simpledialog` module
contains convenience classes and functions for creating simple modal
dialogs to get a value from the user.

::: function
askfloat(title, prompt, *, initialvalue=None, minvalue=None,
maxvalue=None, parent=None) askinteger(title, prompt,*,
initialvalue=None, minvalue=None, maxvalue=None, parent=None)
askstring(title, prompt, \*, initialvalue=None, show=None, parent=None)

Prompt the user to enter a value of the desired type and return it, or
`None` if the dialog is cancelled.

*title* is the dialog title and *prompt* the message shown above the
entry. *initialvalue* is the value initially placed in the entry.
*parent* is the window over which the dialog is shown.
`askinteger` and
`askfloat` also accept *minvalue* and
*maxvalue*, which bound the accepted value.
`askstring` also accepts *show*, a
character used to mask the entered text, for example `'*'` to hide a
password.
:::

::::::::: {.Dialog(parent, .title=None)}
The base class for custom dialogs. Instantiating it shows the dialog
modally and returns once the user closes it; the entered value is then
available in the `!result` attribute.

::: attribute
result

The value produced by `apply`, or `None`
if the dialog was cancelled.
:::

::: method
body(master)

Override to construct the dialog\'s interface and return the widget that
should have initial focus.
:::

::: method
buttonbox()

Default behaviour adds OK and Cancel buttons. Override for custom button
layouts.
:::

::: method
validate()

Validate the data entered by the user. Return true if it is valid, in
which case the dialog proceeds to `apply`; return false to keep the dialog open. The default
implementation always returns true; override it to check the input.
:::

::: method
apply()

Process the data entered by the user, for example by storing it in the
`!result` attribute. Called after
`validate` succeeds and just before the
dialog is destroyed. The default implementation does nothing; override
it to act on or store the result.
:::

::: method
destroy()

Destroy the dialog window, clearing the reference to the widget that had
the initial focus.
:::
:::::::::

:::: {.SimpleDialog(master, .text='', .buttons=[], .default=None, .cancel=None, .title=None, .class_=None)}
A simple modal dialog that displays the message *text* above a row of
push buttons whose labels are given by *buttons*, and returns the index
of the button the user presses. *default* is the index of the button
activated by the Return key, *cancel* the index returned when the window
is closed through the window manager, *title* the window title, and
*class\_* the Tk class name of the window.

::: method
go()

Display the dialog, wait until the user presses a button or closes the
window, and return the index of the chosen button.

## `!tkinter.filedialog` \-\-- File selection dialogs

::: {.module synopsis="Dialog classes for file selection"}
tkinter.filedialog
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/tkinter/filedialog.py`

The `!tkinter.filedialog` module provides
classes and factory functions for creating file/directory selection
windows.

### Native load/save dialogs

The following classes and functions provide file dialog windows that
combine a native look-and-feel with configuration options to customize
behaviour. The following keyword arguments are applicable to the classes
and functions listed below:

> | *parent* - the window to place the dialog on top of
>
> | *title* - the title of the window
>
> | *initialdir* - the directory that the dialog starts in
>
> | *initialfile* - the file selected upon opening of the dialog
>
> | *filetypes* - a sequence of (label, pattern) tuples, \'\*\' wildcard
>   is allowed
>
> | *defaultextension* - default extension to append to file (save
>   dialogs)
>
> | *multiple* - when true, selection of multiple items is allowed

**Static factory functions**

The below functions when called create a modal, native look-and-feel
dialog, wait for the user\'s selection, and return it. The exact return
value depends on the function (see below); when the dialog is cancelled
it is an empty string, an empty tuple, an empty list or `None`.

::: function
askopenfile(mode=\"r\", **options) askopenfiles(mode=\"r\",**options)

Create an `Open` dialog.
`askopenfile` returns the opened file
object, or `None` if the dialog is cancelled.
`askopenfiles` returns a list of the
opened file objects, or an empty list if cancelled. The files are opened
in mode *mode* (read-only `'r'` by default).
:::

::: function
asksaveasfile(mode=\"w\", \*\*options)

Create a `SaveAs` dialog and return the
opened file object, or `None` if the dialog is cancelled. The file is
opened in mode *mode* (`'w'` by default).
:::

::: function
askopenfilename(**options) askopenfilenames(**options)

Create an `Open` dialog.
`askopenfilename` returns the selected
filename as a string, or an empty string if the dialog is cancelled.
`askopenfilenames` returns a tuple of the
selected filenames, or an empty tuple if cancelled.
:::

::: function
asksaveasfilename(\*\*options)

Create a `SaveAs` dialog and return the
selected filename as a string, or an empty string if the dialog is
cancelled.
:::

::: function
askdirectory(\*\*options)

Prompt the user to select a directory, and return its path as a string,
or an empty string if the dialog is cancelled. Additional keyword
option: *mustexist* - if true, the user may only select an existing
directory (false by default).
:::

::: {.Open(master=None, .**options) .SaveAs(master=None, .**options)}
The above two classes provide native dialog windows for saving and
loading files.
:::

**Convenience classes**

The below classes are used for creating file/directory windows from
scratch. These do not emulate the native look-and-feel of the platform.

::: {.Directory(master=None, .**options)}
Create a dialog prompting the user to select a directory.
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The *FileDialog* class should be subclassed for custom event handling
and behaviour.
::::

::::::::::::::::: {.FileDialog(master, .title=None)}
Create a basic file selection dialog.

::: method
cancel_command(event=None)

Trigger the termination of the dialog window.
:::

::: method
dirs_double_event(event)

Event handler for double-click event on directory.
:::

::: method
dirs_select_event(event)

Event handler for click event on directory.
:::

::: method
files_double_event(event)

Event handler for double-click event on file.
:::

::: method
files_select_event(event)

Event handler for single-click event on file.
:::

::: method
filter_command(event=None)

:::

::: method
ok_event(event)

Exit dialog returning current selection.
:::

::: method
ok_command()

Called when the user confirms the current selection. The base
implementation accepts the selection and closes the dialog;
`LoadFileDialog` and
`SaveFileDialog` override it to check
the selection first.
:::

::: method
quit(how=None)

Exit dialog returning filename, if any.
:::

::: method
set_filter(dir, pat)

Set the file filter.
:::

::: method
set_selection(file)

Update the current file selection to *file*.
:::
:::::::::::::::::

:::: {.LoadFileDialog(master, .title=None)}
A subclass of FileDialog that creates a dialog window for selecting an
existing file.

::: method
ok_command()

Test that a file is provided and that the selection indicates an already
existing file.
:::
::::

:::: {.SaveFileDialog(master, .title=None)}
A subclass of FileDialog that creates a dialog window for selecting a
destination file.

::: method
ok_command()

Test whether or not the selection points to a valid file that is not a
directory. Confirmation is required if an already existing file is
selected.
