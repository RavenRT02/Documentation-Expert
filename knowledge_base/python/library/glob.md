# `!glob` \-\-- Unix style pathname pattern expansion

::: {.module synopsis="Unix shell style pathname pattern expansion."}
glob
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/glob.py`

The `!glob` module finds pathnames using
pattern matching rules similar to the Unix shell. No tilde expansion is
done, but `*`, `?`, and character ranges expressed with `[]` will be
correctly matched. This is done by using the
`os.scandir` and
`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions in concert,
and not by actually invoking a subshell.

:::: note

Note
:::

The pathnames are returned in no particular order. If you need a
specific order, sort the results.
::::

Files beginning with a dot (`.`) can only be matched by patterns that
also start with a dot, unlike `fnmatch.fnmatch` or `pathlib.Path.glob`. For
tilde and shell variable expansion, use
`os.path.expanduser` and
`os.path.expandvars`.

For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets. For example,
`'[?]'` matches the character `'?'`.

The `!glob` module defines the following
functions:

::::::::::::::: function
glob(pathname, \*, root_dir=None, dir_fd=None, recursive=False,
include_hidden=False)

Return a possibly empty list of path names that match *pathname*, which
must be a string containing a path specification. *pathname* can be
either absolute (like `/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like
`../../Tools/\*/\*.gif`), and can contain
shell-style wildcards. Broken symlinks are included in the results (as
in the shell). Whether or not the results are sorted depends on the file
system. If a file that satisfies conditions is removed or added during
the call of this function, whether a path name for that file will be
included is unspecified.

If *root_dir* is not `None`, it should be a
`path-like object` specifying the root
directory for searching. It has the same effect on
`!glob` as changing the current directory
before calling it. If *pathname* is relative, the result will contain
paths relative to *root_dir*.

This function can support `paths relative to directory descriptors
<dir_fd>` with the *dir_fd* parameter.

If *recursive* is true, the pattern \"`**`\" will match any files and
zero or more directories, subdirectories and symbolic links to
directories. If the pattern is followed by an `os.sep` or `os.altsep` then files
will not match.

If *include_hidden* is true, \"`**`\" pattern will match hidden
directories.

:::::::::::: function

same values as `glob` without actually
storing them all simultaneously.

:::: function
escape(pathname)

Escape all special characters (`'?'`, `'*'` and `'['`). This is useful
if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may have special
characters in it. Special characters in drive/UNC sharepoints are not
escaped, e.g. on Windows `escape('//?/c:/Quo vadis?.txt')` returns
`'//?/c:/Quo vadis[?].txt'`.

::::: function
translate(pathname, \*, recursive=False, include_hidden=False,
seps=None)

Convert the given path specification to a regular expression for use
with `re.prefixmatch`. The path
specification can contain shell-style wildcards.

For example:

> \>\>\> import glob, re \>\>\> \>\>\> regex =
> glob.translate(\'\*\*/\*.txt\', recursive=True, include_hidden=True)
> \>\>\> regex \'(?s:(?:.+/)?\[\^/\]\*\\.txt)\\z\' \>\>\> reobj =
> re.compile(regex) \>\>\> reobj.prefixmatch(\'foo/bar/baz.txt\')
> \<re.Match object; span=(0, 15), match=\'foo/bar/baz.txt\'\>

Path separators and segments are meaningful to this function, unlike
`fnmatch.translate`. By default wildcards
do not match path separators, and `*` pattern segments match precisely
one path segment.

If *recursive* is true, the pattern segment \"`**`\" will match any
number of path segments.

If *include_hidden* is true, wildcards can match path segments that
start with a dot (`.`).

A sequence of path separators may be supplied to the *seps* argument. If
not given, `os.sep` and
`~os.altsep` (if available) are used.

## Examples

Consider a directory containing the following files:
`1.gif`, `2.txt`, `card.gif` and a
subdirectory `sub` which contains only
the file `3.txt`.
`glob` will produce the following
results. Notice how any leading components of the path are preserved. :

    >>> import glob
    >>> glob.glob('./[0-9].*')
    ['./1.gif', './2.txt']
    >>> glob.glob('*.gif')
    ['1.gif', 'card.gif']
    >>> glob.glob('?.gif')
    ['1.gif']
    >>> glob.glob('**/*.txt', recursive=True)
    ['2.txt', 'sub/3.txt']
    >>> glob.glob('./**/', recursive=True)
    ['./', './sub/']

If the directory contains files starting with `.` they won\'t be matched
by default. For example, consider a directory containing
`card.gif` and
`.card.gif`:

    >>> import glob
    >>> glob.glob('*.gif')
    ['card.gif']
    >>> glob.glob('.c*')
    ['.card.gif']
