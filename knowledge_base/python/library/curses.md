# `!curses` \-\-- Terminal handling for character-cell displays

::: {.module synopsis="An interface to the curses library, providing portable
terminal handling."}
curses
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/curses`

The `!curses` module provides an interface
to the curses library, the de-facto standard for portable advanced
terminal handling.

While curses is most widely used in the Unix environment, versions are
available for Windows, DOS, and possibly other systems as well. This
extension module is designed to match the API of ncurses, an open-source
curses library hosted on Linux and the BSD variants of Unix.

::: availability
not Android, not iOS, not WASI.

This module is not supported on
`mobile platforms <mobile-availability>`
or `WebAssembly platforms <wasm-availability>`.
:::

This is an `optional module`. If it is
missing from your copy of CPython, look for documentation from your
distributor (that is, whoever provided Python to you). If you are the
distributor, see `optional-module-requirements`.

::: availability

## Functions {#curses-functions}

The module `!curses` defines the following
exception:

::: exception
error

Exception raised when a curses library function returns an error.
:::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Whenever *x* or *y* arguments to a function or a method are optional,
they default to the current cursor location. Whenever *attr* is
optional, it defaults to `A_NORMAL`.
::::

The module `!curses` defines the following
functions:

:::: function
assume_default_colors(fg, bg, /)

Allow use of default values for colors on terminals supporting this
feature. Use this to support transparency in your application.

- Assign terminal default foreground/background colors to color number
  `-1`. So `init_pair(x, COLOR_RED, -1)` will initialize pair *x* as red
  on default background and `init_pair(x, -1, COLOR_BLUE)` will
  initialize pair *x* as default foreground on blue.
- Change the definition of the color-pair `0` to `(fg, bg)`.

This is an ncurses extension.

:::
::::

::: function
baudrate()

Return the output speed of the terminal in bits per second. On software
terminal emulators it will have a fixed high value. Included for
historical reasons; in former times, it was used to write output loops
for time delays and occasionally to change interfaces depending on the
line speed.
:::

::: function
beep()

Emit a short attention sound.
:::

::: function
can_change_color()

Return `True` or `False`, depending on whether the programmer can change
the colors displayed by the terminal.
:::

::: function
cbreak()

Enter cbreak mode. In cbreak mode (sometimes called \"rare\" mode)
normal tty line buffering is turned off and characters are available to
be read one by one. However, unlike raw mode, special characters
(interrupt, quit, suspend, and flow control) retain their effects on the
tty driver and calling program. Calling first `raw` then `cbreak` leaves the
terminal in cbreak mode.
:::

::: function
color_content(color_number)

Return the intensity of the red, green, and blue (RGB) components in the
color *color_number*, which must be between `0` and `COLORS - 1`. Return
a 3-tuple, containing the R,G,B values for the given color, which will
be between `0` (no component) and `1000` (maximum amount of component).
Raise an exception if the color is not supported.
:::

::: function
color_pair(pair_number)

Return the attribute value for displaying text in the specified color
pair. Only the first 256 color pairs are supported. This attribute value
can be combined with `A_STANDOUT`,
`A_REVERSE`, and the other
`!A_\*` attributes.
`pair_number` is the counterpart to this
function.
:::

::: function
curs_set(visibility)

Set the cursor state. *visibility* can be set to `0`, `1`, or `2`, for
invisible, normal, or very visible. If the terminal supports the
visibility requested, return the previous cursor state; otherwise raise
an exception. On many terminals, the \"visible\" mode is an underline
cursor and the \"very visible\" mode is a block cursor.
:::

::: function
def_prog_mode()

Save the current terminal mode as the \"program\" mode, the mode when
the running program is using curses. (Its counterpart is the \"shell\"
mode, for when the program is not in curses.) Subsequent calls to
`reset_prog_mode` will restore this mode.
:::

::: function
def_shell_mode()

Save the current terminal mode as the \"shell\" mode, the mode when the
running program is not using curses. (Its counterpart is the \"program\"
mode, when the program is using curses capabilities.) Subsequent calls
to `reset_shell_mode` will restore this
mode.
:::

::: function
delay_output(ms)

Insert an *ms* millisecond pause in output.
:::

::: function
doupdate()

Update the physical screen. The curses library keeps two data
structures, one representing the current physical screen contents and a
virtual screen representing the desired next state. The
`doupdate` function updates the physical
screen to match the virtual screen.

The virtual screen may be updated by a
`~window.noutrefresh` call after write
operations such as `~window.addstr` have
been performed on a window. The normal
`~window.refresh` call is simply
`!noutrefresh` followed by
`!doupdate`; if you have to update
multiple windows, you can speed performance and perhaps reduce screen
flicker by issuing `!noutrefresh` calls
on all windows, followed by a single `!doupdate`.
:::

::: function
echo()

Enter echo mode. In echo mode, each character input is echoed to the
screen as it is entered.
:::

::: function
endwin()

De-initialize the library, and return terminal to normal status.
:::

::: function
erasechar()

Return the user\'s current erase character as a one-byte bytes object.
Under Unix operating systems this is a property of the controlling tty
of the curses program, and is not set by the curses library itself.
:::

::: function
filter()

The `.filter` routine, if used, must be
called before `initscr` is called. The
effect is that, during the initialization, `LINES` is set to `1`; the capabilities `clear`, `cup`, `cud`,
`cud1`, `cuu1`, `cuu`, `vpa` are disabled; and the `home` string is set
to the value of `cr`. The effect is that the cursor is confined to the
current line, and so are screen updates. This may be used for enabling
character-at-a-time line editing without touching the rest of the
screen.
:::

:::: function
nofilter()

Undo the effect of a previous `.filter`
call. Like `.filter`, it must be called
before `initscr` so that the next
initialization uses the full screen again.

Availability: if the underlying curses library provides `nofilter()`.

::: versionadded
next
:::
::::

::: function
flash()

Flash the screen. That is, change it to reverse-video and then change it
back in a short interval. Some people prefer such as \'visible bell\' to
the audible attention signal produced by `beep`.
:::

::: function
flushinp()

Flush all input buffers. This throws away any typeahead that has been
typed by the user and has not yet been processed by the program.
:::

:::: function
getmouse()

After `~window.getch` returns
`KEY_MOUSE` to signal a mouse event,
this method should be called to retrieve the queued mouse event,
represented as a 5-tuple `(id, x, y, z, bstate)`. *id* is an ID value
used to distinguish multiple devices, and *x*, *y*, *z* are the event\'s
coordinates. (*z* is currently unused.) *bstate* is an integer value
whose bits will be set to indicate the type of event, and will be the
bitwise OR of one or more of the following constants, where *n* is the
button number from 1 to 5: `BUTTONn_PRESSED`, `BUTTONn_RELEASED`,
`BUTTONn_CLICKED`,
`BUTTONn_DOUBLE_CLICKED`,
`BUTTONn_TRIPLE_CLICKED`,
`BUTTON_SHIFT`,
`BUTTON_CTRL`,
`BUTTON_ALT`.

::: versionchanged
3.10 The `BUTTON5_*` constants are now exposed if they are provided by
the underlying curses library.
:::
::::

::: function
getsyx()

Return the current coordinates of the virtual screen cursor as a tuple
`(y, x)`. If `leaveok <window.leaveok>`
is currently `True`, then return `(-1, -1)`.
:::

::: function
getwin(file)

Read window-related data stored in the file by an earlier
`window.putwin` call. The routine then
creates and initializes a new window using that data, returning the new
window object. The *file* argument must be a file object opened for
reading in binary mode.
:::

::: function
has_colors()

Return `True` if the terminal can display colors; otherwise, return
`False`.
:::

:::: function
has_extended_color_support()

Return `True` if the module supports extended colors; otherwise, return
`False`. Extended color support allows more than 256 color pairs for
terminals that support more than 16 colors (for example,
xterm-256color).

Extended color support requires ncurses version 6.1 or later.

::: versionadded
3.10
:::
::::

::: function
has_ic()

Return `True` if the terminal has insert- and delete-character
capabilities. This function is included for historical reasons only, as
all modern software terminal emulators have such capabilities.
:::

::: function
has_il()

Return `True` if the terminal has insert- and delete-line capabilities,
or can simulate them using scrolling regions. This function is included
for historical reasons only, as all modern software terminal emulators
have such capabilities.
:::

::: function
has_key(ch)

Take a key value *ch*, and return `True` if the current terminal type
recognizes a key with that value.
:::

::: function
halfdelay(tenths)

Used for half-delay mode, which is similar to cbreak mode in that
characters typed by the user are immediately available to the program.
However, after blocking for *tenths* tenths of seconds, raise an
exception if nothing has been typed. The value of *tenths* must be a
number between `1` and `255`. Use `nocbreak` to leave half-delay mode.
:::

::: function
init_color(color_number, r, g, b)

Change the definition of a color, taking the number of the color to be
changed followed by three RGB values (for the amounts of red, green, and
blue components). The value of *color_number* must be between `0` and
`COLORS - 1`. Each of *r*, *g*, *b*, must be a value between `0` and
`1000`. When `init_color` is used, all
occurrences of that color on the screen immediately change to the new
definition. This function is a no-op on most terminals; it is active
only if `can_change_color` returns
`True`.
:::

::: function
init_pair(pair_number, fg, bg)

Change the definition of a color-pair. It takes three arguments: the
number of the color-pair to be changed, the foreground color number, and
the background color number. The value of *pair_number* must be between
`1` and `COLOR_PAIRS - 1` (the `0` color pair can only be changed by
`use_default_colors` and
`assume_default_colors`). The value of
*fg* and *bg* arguments must be between `0` and `COLORS - 1`, or, after
calling `!use_default_colors` or
`!assume_default_colors`, `-1`. If the
color-pair was previously initialized, the screen is refreshed and all
occurrences of that color-pair are changed to the new definition.
:::

::::: function
initscr()

Initialize the library. Return a
`window <curses-window-objects>` object
which represents the whole screen.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If there is an error opening the terminal, the underlying curses library
may cause the interpreter to exit.
::::
:::::

::: function
intrflush(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, pressing an interrupt key (interrupt, break, or
quit) will flush all output in the terminal driver queue. If *flag* is
`False`, no flushing is done.
:::

::: function
is_term_resized(nlines, ncols)

Return `True` if `resize_term` would
modify the window structure, `False` otherwise.
:::

::: function
isendwin()

Return `True` if `endwin` has been called
(that is, the curses library has been deinitialized).
:::

::: function
keyname(k)

Return the name of the key numbered *k* as a bytes object. The name of a
key generating printable ASCII character is the key\'s character. The
name of a control-key combination is a two-byte bytes object consisting
of a caret (`b'^'`) followed by the corresponding printable ASCII
character. The name of an alt-key combination (128\--255) is a bytes
object consisting of the prefix `b'M-'` followed by the name of the
corresponding ASCII character.

Raise a `ValueError` if *k* is negative.
:::

::: function
killchar()

Return the user\'s current line kill character as a one-byte bytes
object. Under Unix operating systems this is a property of the
controlling tty of the curses program, and is not set by the curses
library itself.
:::

::: function
longname()

Return a bytes object containing the terminfo long name field describing
the current terminal. The maximum length of a verbose description is 128
characters. It is defined only after the call to
`initscr`.
:::

::: function
meta(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, allow 8-bit characters to be input. If *flag* is
`False`, allow only 7-bit chars.
:::

::: function
mouseinterval(interval)

Set the maximum time in milliseconds that can elapse between press and
release events in order for them to be recognized as a click, and return
the previous interval value. The default value is 166 milliseconds, or
one sixth of a second. Use a negative *interval* to obtain the interval
value without changing it.
:::

::: function
mousemask(mousemask)

Set the mouse events to be reported, and return a tuple
`(availmask, oldmask)`. *availmask* indicates which of the specified
mouse events can be reported; on complete failure it returns `0`.
*oldmask* is the previous value of the mouse event mask. If this
function is never called, no mouse events are ever reported.
:::

::: function
napms(ms)

Sleep for *ms* milliseconds.
:::

::: function
newpad(nlines, ncols)

Create and return a pointer to a new pad data structure with the given
number of lines and columns. Return a pad as a window object.

A pad is like a window, except that it is not restricted by the screen
size, and is not necessarily associated with a particular part of the
screen. Pads can be used when a large window is needed, and only a part
of the window will be on the screen at one time. Automatic refreshes of
pads (such as from scrolling or echoing of input) do not occur. The
`~window.refresh` and
`~window.noutrefresh` methods of a pad
require 6 arguments to specify the part of the pad to be displayed and
the location on the screen to be used for the display. The arguments are
*pminrow*, *pmincol*, *sminrow*, *smincol*, *smaxrow*, *smaxcol*; the
*p* arguments refer to the upper-left corner of the pad region to be
displayed and the *s* arguments define a clipping box on the screen
within which the pad region is to be displayed.
:::

::: function
newwin(nlines, ncols) newwin(nlines, ncols, begin_y, begin_x)

Return a new `window <curses-window-objects>`, whose left-upper corner is at `(begin_y, begin_x)`, and
whose height/width is *nlines*/\*ncols\*.

By default, the window will extend from the specified position to the
lower right corner of the screen.
:::

::: function
nl(flag=True)

Enter newline mode. This mode translates the return key into newline on
input, and translates newline into return and line-feed on output.
Newline mode is initially on.

If *flag* is `False`, the effect is the same as calling
`nonl`.
:::

::: function
nocbreak()

Leave cbreak mode. Return to normal \"cooked\" mode with line buffering.
:::

::: function
noecho()

Leave echo mode. Echoing of input characters is turned off.
:::

::: function
nonl()

Leave newline mode. Disable translation of return into newline on input,
and disable low-level translation of newline into newline/return on
output (but this does not change the behavior of `addch('\n')`, which
always does the equivalent of return and line feed on the virtual
screen). With translation off, curses can sometimes speed up vertical
motion a little; also, it will be able to detect the return key on
input.
:::

::: function
noqiflush()

When the `!noqiflush` routine is used,
normal flush of input and output queues associated with the `INTR`,
`QUIT` and `SUSP` characters will not be done. You may want to call
`!noqiflush` in a signal handler if you
want output to continue as though the interrupt had not occurred, after
the handler exits.
:::

::: function
noraw()

Leave raw mode. Return to normal \"cooked\" mode with line buffering.
:::

::: function
pair_content(pair_number)

Return a tuple `(fg, bg)` containing the colors for the requested color
pair. The value of *pair_number* must be between `0` and
`COLOR_PAIRS - 1`.
:::

::: function
pair_number(attr)

Return the number of the color-pair set by the attribute value *attr*.
`color_pair` is the counterpart to this
function.
:::

::: function
putp(str)

Equivalent to `tputs(str, 1, putchar)`; emit the value of a specified
terminfo capability for the current terminal. Note that the output of
`putp` always goes to standard output.

`setupterm` (or
`initscr`) must be called first.
:::

::: function
qiflush(\[flag\])

If *flag* is `False`, the effect is the same as calling
`noqiflush`. If *flag* is `True`, or no
argument is provided, the queues will be flushed when these control
characters are read.
:::

::: function
raw()

Enter raw mode. In raw mode, normal line buffering and processing of
interrupt, quit, suspend, and flow control keys are turned off;
characters are presented to curses input functions one by one.
:::

::: function
reset_prog_mode()

Restore the terminal to \"program\" mode, as previously saved by
`def_prog_mode`.
:::

::: function
reset_shell_mode()

Restore the terminal to \"shell\" mode, as previously saved by
`def_shell_mode`.
:::

::: function
resetty()

Restore the state of the terminal modes to what it was at the last call
to `savetty`.
:::

::: function
resize_term(nlines, ncols)

Backend function used by `resizeterm`,
performing most of the work; when resizing the windows,
`resize_term` blank-fills the areas that
are extended. The calling application should fill in these areas with
appropriate data. The `!resize_term`
function attempts to resize all windows. However, due to the calling
convention of pads, it is not possible to resize these without
additional interaction with the application.
:::

::: function
resizeterm(nlines, ncols)

Resize the standard and current windows to the specified dimensions, and
adjusts other bookkeeping data used by the curses library that record
the window dimensions (in particular the SIGWINCH handler).
:::

::: function
savetty()

Save the current state of the terminal modes in a buffer, usable by
`resetty`.
:::

:::: function
get_escdelay()

Retrieves the value set by `set_escdelay`.

::: versionadded
3.9
:::
::::

:::: function
set_escdelay(ms)

Sets the number of milliseconds to wait after reading an escape
character, to distinguish between an individual escape character entered
on the keyboard from escape sequences sent by cursor and function keys.

::: versionadded
3.9
:::
::::

:::: function
get_tabsize()

Retrieves the value set by `set_tabsize`.

::: versionadded
3.9
:::
::::

:::: function
set_tabsize(size)

Sets the number of columns used by the curses library when converting a
tab character to spaces as it adds the tab to a window.

::: versionadded
3.9
:::
::::

::: function
setsyx(y, x)

Set the virtual screen cursor to *y*, *x*. If *y* and *x* are both `-1`,
then `leaveok <window.leaveok>` is set
`True`.
:::

::: function
setupterm(term=None, fd=-1)

Initialize the terminal. *term* is a string giving the terminal name, or
`None`; if omitted or `None`, the value of the `TERM` environment variable will be used. *fd* is the file
descriptor to which any initialization sequences will be sent; if not
supplied or `-1`, the file descriptor for `sys.stdout` will be used.

Raise a `curses.error` if the terminal
could not be found or its terminfo database entry could not be read. If
the terminal has already been initialized, this function has no effect.
:::

::: function
start_color()

Must be called if the programmer wants to use colors, and before any
other color manipulation routine is called. It is good practice to call
this routine right after `initscr`.

`start_color` initializes eight basic
colors (black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white), and
two global variables in the `!curses`
module, `COLORS` and
`COLOR_PAIRS`, containing the maximum
number of colors and color-pairs the terminal can support. It also
restores the colors on the terminal to the values they had when the
terminal was just turned on.
:::

::: function
termattrs()

Return a logical OR of all video attributes supported by the terminal.
This information is useful when a curses program needs complete control
over the appearance of the screen.
:::

::: function
termname()

Return the value of the environment variable `TERM`, as a bytes object, truncated to 14 characters.
:::

::: function
tigetflag(capname)

Return the value of the Boolean capability corresponding to the terminfo
capability name *capname* as an integer. Return the value `-1` if
*capname* is not a Boolean capability, or `0` if it is canceled or
absent from the terminal description.

`setupterm` (or
`initscr`) must be called first.
:::

::: function
tigetnum(capname)

Return the value of the numeric capability corresponding to the terminfo
capability name *capname* as an integer. Return the value `-2` if
*capname* is not a numeric capability, or `-1` if it is canceled or
absent from the terminal description.

`setupterm` (or
`initscr`) must be called first.
:::

::: function
tigetstr(capname)

Return the value of the string capability corresponding to the terminfo
capability name *capname* as a bytes object. Return `None` if *capname*
is not a terminfo \"string capability\", or is canceled or absent from
the terminal description.

`setupterm` (or
`initscr`) must be called first.
:::

::: function
tparm(str\[, \...\])

Instantiate the bytes object *str* with the supplied parameters, where
*str* should be a parameterized string obtained from the terminfo
database. For example, `tparm(tigetstr("cup"), 5, 3)` could result in
`b'\033[6;4H'`, the exact result depending on terminal type. Up to nine
integer parameters may be supplied.

`setupterm` (or
`initscr`) must be called first.
:::

::: function
typeahead(fd)

Specify that the file descriptor *fd* be used for typeahead checking. If
*fd* is `-1`, then no typeahead checking is done.

The curses library does \"line-breakout optimization\" by looking for
typeahead periodically while updating the screen. If input is found, and
it is coming from a tty, the current update is postponed until refresh
or doupdate is called again, allowing faster response to commands typed
in advance. This function allows specifying a different file descriptor
for typeahead checking.
:::

::: function
unctrl(ch)

Return a bytes object which is a printable representation of the
character *ch*. Control characters are represented as a caret followed
by the character, for example as `b'^C'`. Printing characters are left
as they are.
:::

::::: function
ungetch(ch)

Push *ch* so the next `~window.getch`
will return it.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Only one *ch* can be pushed before `!getch` is called.

:::::

:::: function
update_lines_cols()

Update the `LINES` and
`COLS` module variables. Useful for
detecting manual screen resize.

::: versionadded
3.5
:::
::::

:::::: function
unget_wch(ch)

Push *ch* so the next `~window.get_wch`
will return it.

:::: note

3.3
:::
::::::

::: function
ungetmouse(id, x, y, z, bstate)

Push a `KEY_MOUSE` event onto the input
queue, associating the given state data with it.
:::

::: function
use_env(flag)

If used, this function should be called before
`initscr` or newterm are called. When
*flag* is `False`, the values of lines and columns specified in the
terminfo database will be used, even if environment variables
`LINES` and `COLUMNS` (used by default) are set, or if curses is running in a
window (in which case default behavior would be to use the window size
if `LINES` and
`COLUMNS` are not set).
:::

::: function
use_default_colors()

Equivalent to `assume_default_colors(-1, -1)`.
:::

::: function
wrapper(func, /, *args,*\*kwargs)

Initialize curses and call another callable object, *func*, which should
be the rest of your curses-using application. If the application raises
an exception, this function will restore the terminal to a sane state
before re-raising the exception and generating a traceback. The callable
object *func* is then passed the main window \'stdscr\' as its first
argument, followed by any other arguments passed to
`!wrapper`. Before calling *func*,
`!wrapper` turns on cbreak mode, turns
off echo, enables the terminal keypad, and initializes colors if the
terminal has color support. On exit (whether normally or by exception)
it restores cooked mode, turns on echo, and disables the terminal
keypad.
:::

## Window objects {#curses-window-objects}

::: window
Window objects, as returned by `initscr`
and `newwin` above, have the following
methods and attributes:
:::

::::: method
window.addch(ch\[, attr\]) window.addch(y, x, ch\[, attr\])

Paint character *ch* at `(y, x)` with attributes *attr*, overwriting any
character previously painted at that location. By default, the character
position and attributes are the current settings for the window object.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Writing outside the window, subwindow, or pad raises a
`curses.error`. Attempting to write to the
lower-right corner of a window, subwindow, or pad will cause an
exception to be raised after the character is printed.
::::
:::::

::: method
window.addnstr(str, n\[, attr\]) window.addnstr(y, x, str, n\[, attr\])

Paint at most *n* characters of the character string *str* at `(y, x)`
with attributes *attr*, overwriting anything previously on the display.
:::

::::: method
window.addstr(str\[, attr\]) window.addstr(y, x, str\[, attr\])

Paint the character string *str* at `(y, x)` with attributes *attr*,
overwriting anything previously on the display.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- Writing outside the window, subwindow, or pad raises
  `curses.error`. Attempting to write to
  the lower-right corner of a window, subwindow, or pad will cause an
  exception to be raised after the string is printed.
- A bug in ncurses, the backend for this Python module, could cause
  segfaults when resizing windows. This was fixed in
  ncurses-6.1-20190511. If you are stuck with an earlier ncurses, you
  can avoid triggering it by not calling `!addstr` with a *str* that has embedded newlines; instead, call
  `!addstr` separately for each line.
::::
:::::

::: method
window.attroff(attr)

Remove attribute *attr* from the \"background\" set applied to all
writes to the current window.
:::

::: method
window.attron(attr)

Add attribute *attr* to the \"background\" set applied to all writes to
the current window.
:::

::: method
window.attrset(attr)

Set the \"background\" set of attributes to *attr*. This set is
initially `0` (no attributes).
:::

::: method
window.bkgd(ch\[, attr\])

Set the background property of the window to the character *ch*, with
attributes *attr*. The change is then applied to every character
position in that window:

- The attribute of every character in the window is changed to the new
  background attribute.
- Wherever the former background character appears, it is changed to the
  new background character.
:::

::: method
window.bkgdset(ch\[, attr\])

Set the window\'s background. A window\'s background consists of a
character and any combination of attributes. The attribute part of the
background is combined (OR\'ed) with all non-blank characters that are
written into the window. Both the character and attribute parts of the
background are combined with the blank characters. The background
becomes a property of the character and moves with the character through
any scrolling and insert/delete line/character operations.
:::

::::: method
window.border(\[ls\[, rs\[, ts\[, bs\[, tl\[, tr\[, bl\[,
br\]\]\]\]\]\]\]\])

Draw a border around the edges of the window. Each parameter specifies
the character to use for a specific part of the border; see the table
below for more details.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

A `0` value for any parameter will cause the default character to be
used for that parameter. Keyword parameters can *not* be used. The
defaults are listed in this table:
::::

  Parameter   Description           Default value
  ----------- --------------------- ----------------------------------
  *ls*        Left side             `ACS_VLINE`

  *rs*        Right side            `ACS_VLINE`

  *ts*        Top                   `ACS_HLINE`

  *bs*        Bottom                `ACS_HLINE`

  *tl*        Upper-left corner     `ACS_ULCORNER`

  *tr*        Upper-right corner    `ACS_URCORNER`

  *bl*        Bottom-left corner    `ACS_LLCORNER`

  *br*        Bottom-right corner   `ACS_LRCORNER`

:::::

::: method
window.box(\[vertch, horch\])

Similar to `border`, but both *ls* and
*rs* are *vertch* and both *ts* and *bs* are *horch*. The default corner
characters are always used by this function.
:::

::: method
window.chgat(attr) window.chgat(num, attr) window.chgat(y, x, attr)
window.chgat(y, x, num, attr)

Set the attributes of *num* characters at the current cursor position,
or at position `(y, x)` if supplied. If *num* is not given or is `-1`,
the attribute will be set on all the characters to the end of the line.
This function moves cursor to position `(y, x)` if supplied. The changed
line will be touched using the `touchline` method so that the contents will be redisplayed by the next
window refresh.
:::

::: method
window.clear()

Like `erase`, but also cause the whole
window to be repainted upon next call to `refresh`.
:::

::: method
window.clearok(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, the next call to `refresh` will clear the window completely.
:::

::: method
window.clrtobot()

Erase from cursor to the end of the window: all lines below the cursor
are deleted, and then the equivalent of `clrtoeol` is performed.
:::

::: method
window.clrtoeol()

Erase from cursor to the end of the line.
:::

::: method
window.cursyncup()

Update the current cursor position of all the ancestors of the window to
reflect the current cursor position of the window.
:::

::: method
window.delch(\[y, x\])

Delete the character under the cursor, or at `(y, x)` if specified. All
characters to the right on the same line are shifted one position left.
:::

::: method
window.deleteln()

Delete the line under the cursor. All following lines are moved up by
one line.
:::

::: method
window.derwin(begin_y, begin_x) window.derwin(nlines, ncols, begin_y,
begin_x)

An abbreviation for \"derive window\", `derwin` is the same as calling `subwin`, except that *begin_y* and *begin_x* are relative to the
origin of the window, rather than relative to the entire screen. Return
a window object for the derived window.
:::

::: method
window.echochar(ch\[, attr\])

Add character *ch* with attribute *attr*, and immediately call
`refresh` on the window.
:::

:::: method
window.enclose(y, x)

Test whether the given pair of screen-relative character-cell
coordinates are enclosed by the given window, returning `True` or
`False`. It is useful for determining what subset of the screen windows
enclose the location of a mouse event.

::: versionchanged
3.10 Previously it returned `1` or `0` instead of `True` or `False`.
:::
::::

:::: attribute
window.encoding

Encoding used to encode method arguments (Unicode strings and
characters). The encoding attribute is inherited from the parent window
when a subwindow is created, for example with
`window.subwin`. By default, current
locale encoding is used (see `locale.getencoding`).

::: versionadded
3.3
:::
::::

::: method
window.erase()

Clear the window.
:::

::: method
window.getbegyx()

Return a tuple `(y, x)` of coordinates of upper-left corner.
:::

::: method
window.getbkgd()

Return the given window\'s current background character/attribute pair.
:::

::: method
window.getch(\[y, x\])

Get a character. Note that the integer returned does *not* have to be in
ASCII range: function keys, keypad keys and so on are represented by
numbers higher than 255. In no-delay mode, return `-1` if there is no
input, otherwise wait until a key is pressed.
:::

:::: method
window.get_wch(\[y, x\])

Get a wide character. Return a character for most keys, or an integer
for function keys, keypad keys, and other special keys. In no-delay
mode, raise an exception if there is no input.

::: versionadded
3.3
:::
::::

::: method
window.getkey(\[y, x\])

Get a character, returning a string instead of an integer, as
`getch` does. Function keys, keypad keys
and other special keys return a multibyte string containing the key
name. In no-delay mode, raise an exception if there is no input.
:::

::: method
window.getmaxyx()

Return a tuple `(y, x)` of the height and width of the window.
:::

::: method
window.getparyx()

Return the beginning coordinates of this window relative to its parent
window as a tuple `(y, x)`. Return `(-1, -1)` if this window has no
parent.
:::

:::: method
window.getstr() window.getstr(n) window.getstr(y, x) window.getstr(y, x,
n)

Read a bytes object from the user, with primitive line editing capacity.
At most *n* characters are read; *n* defaults to and cannot exceed 2047.

::: versionchanged
3.14 The maximum value for *n* was increased from 1023 to 2047.
:::
::::

::: method
window.getyx()

Return a tuple `(y, x)` of current cursor position relative to the
window\'s upper-left corner.
:::

::: method
window.hline(ch, n\[, attr\]) window.hline(y, x, ch, n\[, attr\])

Display a horizontal line starting at `(y, x)` with length *n*
consisting of the character *ch* with attributes *attr*. The line stops
at the right edge of the window if fewer than *n* cells are available.
:::

::: method
window.idcok(flag)

If *flag* is `False`, curses no longer considers using the hardware
insert/delete character feature of the terminal; if *flag* is `True`,
use of character insertion and deletion is enabled. When curses is first
initialized, use of character insert/delete is enabled by default.
:::

::: method
window.idlok(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, `!curses` will try to
use hardware line editing facilities. Otherwise, curses will not use
them.
:::

::: method
window.immedok(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, any change in the window image automatically causes
the window to be refreshed; you no longer have to call
`refresh` yourself. However, it may
degrade performance considerably, due to repeated calls to wrefresh.
This option is disabled by default.
:::

::: method
window.inch(\[y, x\])

Return the character at the given position in the window. The bottom 8
bits are the character proper, and upper bits are the attributes.
:::

::: method
window.insch(ch\[, attr\]) window.insch(y, x, ch\[, attr\])

Insert character *ch* with attributes *attr* before the character under
the cursor, or at `(y, x)` if specified. All characters to the right of
the cursor are shifted one position right, with the rightmost character
on the line being lost. The cursor position does not change.
:::

::: method
window.insdelln(nlines)

Insert *nlines* lines into the specified window above the current line.
The *nlines* bottom lines are lost. For negative *nlines*, delete
*nlines* lines starting with the one under the cursor, and move the
remaining lines up. The bottom *nlines* lines are cleared. The current
cursor position remains the same.
:::

::: method
window.insertln()

Insert a blank line under the cursor. All following lines are moved down
by one line.
:::

::: method
window.insnstr(str, n\[, attr\]) window.insnstr(y, x, str, n\[, attr\])

Insert a character string (as many characters as will fit on the line)
before the character under the cursor, up to *n* characters. If *n* is
zero or negative, the entire string is inserted. All characters to the
right of the cursor are shifted right, with the rightmost characters on
the line being lost. The cursor position does not change (after moving
to *y*, *x*, if specified).
:::

::: method
window.insstr(str\[, attr\]) window.insstr(y, x, str\[, attr\])

Insert a character string (as many characters as will fit on the line)
before the character under the cursor. All characters to the right of
the cursor are shifted right, with the rightmost characters on the line
being lost. The cursor position does not change (after moving to *y*,
*x*, if specified).
:::

:::: method
window.instr(\[n\]) window.instr(y, x\[, n\])

Return a bytes object of characters, extracted from the window starting
at the current cursor position, or at *y*, *x* if specified, and
stopping at the end of the line. Attributes and color information are
stripped from the characters. If *n* is specified,
`instr` returns a string at most *n*
characters long (exclusive of the trailing NUL). The maximum value for
*n* is 2047.

::: versionchanged
3.14 The maximum value for *n* was increased from 1023 to 2047.
:::
::::

::: method
window.is_linetouched(line)

Return `True` if the specified line was modified since the last call to
`refresh`; otherwise return `False`.
Raise a `curses.error` exception if *line*
is not valid for the given window.
:::

::: method
window.is_wintouched()

Return `True` if the specified window was modified since the last call
to `refresh`; otherwise return `False`.
:::

::: method
window.keypad(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, escape sequences generated by some keys (keypad,
function keys) will be interpreted by `!curses`. If *flag* is `False`, escape sequences will be left as is
in the input stream.
:::

::: method
window.leaveok(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, cursor is left where it is on update, instead of
being at \"cursor position.\" This reduces cursor movement where
possible.

If *flag* is `False`, cursor will always be at \"cursor position\" after
an update.
:::

::: method
window.move(new_y, new_x)

Move cursor to `(new_y, new_x)`.
:::

::: method
window.mvderwin(y, x)

Move the window inside its parent window. The screen-relative parameters
of the window are not changed. This routine is used to display different
parts of the parent window at the same physical position on the screen.
:::

::: method
window.mvwin(new_y, new_x)

Move the window so its upper-left corner is at `(new_y, new_x)`.

Moving the window so that any part of it would be off the screen is an
error: the window is not moved and `curses.error` is raised.
:::

::: method
window.nodelay(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, `getch` will be
non-blocking.
:::

::: method
window.notimeout(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, escape sequences will not be timed out.

If *flag* is `False`, after a few milliseconds, an escape sequence will
not be interpreted, and will be left in the input stream as is.
:::

::: method
window.noutrefresh() window.noutrefresh(pminrow, pmincol, sminrow,
smincol, smaxrow, smaxcol)

Mark for refresh but wait. This function updates the data structure
representing the desired state of the window, but does not force an
update of the physical screen. To accomplish that, call
`doupdate`.

The 6 arguments can only be specified, and are then required, when the
window is a pad created with `newpad`;
they have the same meaning as for `refresh`.
:::

::: method
window.overlay(destwin\[, sminrow, smincol, dminrow, dmincol, dmaxrow,
dmaxcol\])

Overlay the window on top of *destwin*. The windows need not be the same
size, only the overlapping region is copied. This copy is
non-destructive, which means that the current background character does
not overwrite the old contents of *destwin*.

To get fine-grained control over the copied region, the second form of
`overlay` can be used. *sminrow* and
*smincol* are the upper-left coordinates of the source window, and the
other variables mark a rectangle in the destination window.
:::

::: method
window.overwrite(destwin\[, sminrow, smincol, dminrow, dmincol, dmaxrow,
dmaxcol\])

Overwrite the window on top of *destwin*. The windows need not be the
same size, in which case only the overlapping region is copied. This
copy is destructive, which means that the current background character
overwrites the old contents of *destwin*.

To get fine-grained control over the copied region, the second form of
`overwrite` can be used. *sminrow* and
*smincol* are the upper-left coordinates of the source window, the other
variables mark a rectangle in the destination window.
:::

::: method
window.putwin(file)

Write all data associated with the window into the provided file object.
This information can be later retrieved using the
`getwin` function.
:::

::: method
window.redrawln(beg, num)

Indicate that the *num* screen lines, starting at line *beg*, are
corrupted and should be completely redrawn on the next
`refresh` call.
:::

::: method
window.redrawwin()

Touch the entire window, causing it to be completely redrawn on the next
`refresh` call.
:::

::: method
window.refresh(\[pminrow, pmincol, sminrow, smincol, smaxrow, smaxcol\])

Update the display immediately (sync actual screen with previous
drawing/deleting methods).

The 6 arguments can only be specified, and are then required, when the
window is a pad created with `newpad`.
The additional parameters are needed to indicate what part of the pad
and screen are involved. *pminrow* and *pmincol* specify the upper-left
corner of the rectangle to be displayed in the pad. *sminrow*,
*smincol*, *smaxrow*, and *smaxcol* specify the edges of the rectangle
to be displayed on the screen. The lower-right corner of the rectangle
to be displayed in the pad is calculated from the screen coordinates,
since the rectangles must be the same size. Both rectangles must be
entirely contained within their respective structures. Negative values
of *pminrow*, *pmincol*, *sminrow*, or *smincol* are treated as if they
were zero.
:::

::: method
window.resize(nlines, ncols)

Reallocate storage for a curses window to adjust its dimensions to the
specified values. If either dimension is larger than the current values,
the window\'s data is filled with blanks that have the current
background rendition (as set by `bkgdset`) merged into them.
:::

::: method
window.scroll(\[lines=1\])

Scroll the screen or scrolling region. Scroll upward by *lines* lines if
*lines* is positive, or downward if it is negative. Scrolling has no
effect unless it has been enabled for the window with
`scrollok`.
:::

::: method
window.scrollok(flag)

Control what happens when the cursor of a window is moved off the edge
of the window or scrolling region, either as a result of a newline
action on the bottom line, or typing the last character of the last
line. If *flag* is `False`, the cursor is left on the bottom line. If
*flag* is `True`, the window is scrolled up one line. Note that in order
to get the physical scrolling effect on the terminal, it is also
necessary to call `idlok`.
:::

::: method
window.setscrreg(top, bottom)

Set the scrolling region from line *top* to line *bottom*. All scrolling
actions will take place in this region.
:::

::: method
window.standend()

Turn off the standout attribute. On some terminals this has the side
effect of turning off all attributes.
:::

::: method
window.standout()

Turn on attribute *A_STANDOUT*.
:::

::: method
window.subpad(begin_y, begin_x) window.subpad(nlines, ncols, begin_y,
begin_x)

Return a sub-pad, whose upper-left corner is at `(begin_y, begin_x)`,
and whose width/height is *ncols*/\*nlines\*. The coordinates are
relative to the parent pad (unlike `subwin`, which uses screen coordinates). This method is only
available for pads created with `newpad`.
:::

::: method
window.subwin(begin_y, begin_x) window.subwin(nlines, ncols, begin_y,
begin_x)

Return a sub-window, whose upper-left corner is at the screen-relative
coordinates `(begin_y, begin_x)`, and whose width/height is
*ncols*/\*nlines\*.

By default, the sub-window will extend from the specified position to
the lower right corner of the window.
:::

::: method
window.syncdown()

Touch each location in the window that has been touched in any of its
ancestor windows. This routine is called by `refresh`, so it should almost never be necessary to call it
manually.
:::

::: method
window.syncok(flag)

If *flag* is `True`, then `syncup` is
called automatically whenever there is a change in the window.
:::

::: method
window.syncup()

Touch all locations in ancestors of the window that have been changed in
the window.
:::

::: method
window.timeout(delay)

Set blocking or non-blocking read behavior for the window. If *delay* is
negative, blocking read is used (which will wait indefinitely for
input). If *delay* is zero, then non-blocking read is used, and
`getch` will return `-1` if no input is
waiting. If *delay* is positive, then `getch` will block for *delay* milliseconds, and return `-1` if
there is still no input at the end of that time.
:::

::: method
window.touchline(start, count\[, changed\])

Pretend *count* lines have been changed, starting with line *start*. If
*changed* is supplied, it specifies whether the affected lines are
marked as having been changed (*changed*`=True`) or unchanged
(*changed*`=False`).
:::

::: method
window.touchwin()

Pretend the whole window has been changed, for purposes of drawing
optimizations.
:::

::: method
window.untouchwin()

Mark all lines in the window as unchanged since the last call to
`refresh`.
:::

::: method
window.vline(ch, n\[, attr\]) window.vline(y, x, ch, n\[, attr\])

Display a vertical line starting at `(y, x)` with length *n* consisting
of the character *ch* with attributes *attr*.
:::

## Constants

The `!curses` module defines the following
data members:

::: data
ERR

Some curses routines that return an integer, such as
`~window.getch`, return
`ERR` upon failure.
:::

::: data
OK

Some curses routines that return an integer, such as
`napms`, return `OK` upon success.
:::

::: data
version

A bytes object representing the current version of the module.
:::

:::: data
ncurses_version

A named tuple containing the three components of the ncurses library
version: *major*, *minor*, and *patch*. All values are integers. The
components can also be accessed by name, so `curses.ncurses_version[0]`
is equivalent to `curses.ncurses_version.major` and so on.

Availability: if the ncurses library is used.

::: versionadded

::::

::: data
COLORS

The maximum number of colors the terminal can support. It is defined
only after the call to `start_color`.
:::

::: data
COLOR_PAIRS

The maximum number of color pairs the terminal can support. It is
defined only after the call to `start_color`.
:::

::: data
COLS

The width of the screen, that is, the number of columns. It is defined
only after the call to `initscr`. Updated
by `update_lines_cols`,
`resizeterm` and
`resize_term`.
:::

::: data
LINES

The height of the screen, that is, the number of lines. It is defined
only after the call to `initscr`. Updated
by `update_lines_cols`,
`resizeterm` and
`resize_term`.

On VT100s and their software emulations, such as X terminal emulators,
there are normally at least four function keys
(`KEY_F1 <KEY_Fn>`,
`KEY_F2 <KEY_Fn>`,
`KEY_F3 <KEY_Fn>`,
`KEY_F4 <KEY_Fn>`) available, and the
arrow keys mapped to `KEY_UP`,
`KEY_DOWN`, `KEY_LEFT` and `KEY_RIGHT` in the
obvious way. If your machine has a PC keyboard, it is safe to expect
arrow keys and twelve function keys (older PC keyboards may have only
ten function keys); also, the following keypad mappings are standard:

  Keycap                          Constant
  ------------------------------- -----------
  `Insert`

  `Delete`

  `Home`

  `End`

  `Page Up`

  `Page Down`

::: {#curses-acs-codes}
The following table lists characters from the alternate character set.
These are inherited from the VT100 terminal, and will generally be
available on software emulations such as X terminals. When there is no
graphic available, curses falls back on a crude printable ASCII
approximation.

# `!curses.textpad` \-\-- Text input widget for curses programs

::: {.module synopsis="Emacs-like input editing in a curses window."}
curses.textpad
:::

The `!curses.textpad` module provides a
`Textbox` class that handles elementary
text editing in a curses window, supporting a set of keybindings
resembling those of Emacs (thus, also of Netscape Navigator, BBedit 6.x,
FrameMaker, and many other programs). The module also provides a
rectangle-drawing function useful for framing text boxes or for other
purposes.

The module `!curses.textpad` defines the
following function:

::: function
rectangle(win, uly, ulx, lry, lrx)

Draw a rectangle. The first argument must be a window object; the
remaining arguments are coordinates relative to that window. The second
and third arguments are the y and x coordinates of the upper-left corner
of the rectangle to be drawn; the fourth and fifth arguments are the y
and x coordinates of the lower-right corner. The rectangle will be drawn
using VT100/IBM PC forms characters on terminals that make this possible
(including xterm and most other software terminal emulators). Otherwise
it will be drawn with ASCII dashes, vertical bars, and plus signs.
:::

## Textbox objects {#curses-textpad-objects}

You can instantiate a `Textbox` object
as follows:

::::::: {.Textbox(win, .insert_mode=False)}
Return a textbox widget object. The *win* argument should be a curses
`window <curses-window-objects>` object in
which the textbox is to be contained. If *insert_mode* is true, the
textbox inserts typed characters, shifting existing text to the right,
rather than overwriting it. The edit cursor of the textbox is initially
located at the upper-left corner of the containing window, with
coordinates `(0, 0)`. The instance\'s `stripspaces` flag is initially on.

`Textbox` objects have the following
methods:

::: method
edit(validate=None)

This is the entry point you will normally use. It accepts editing
keystrokes until one of the termination keystrokes is entered. If
*validate* is supplied, it must be a function. It will be called for
each keystroke entered with the keystroke as a parameter; command
dispatch is done on the result. If it returns a false value, the
keystroke is ignored. This method returns the window contents as a
string; whether blanks in the window are included is affected by the
`stripspaces` attribute.
:::

::: method
do_command(ch)

Process a single command keystroke. Returns `1` to continue editing, or
`0` if a termination keystroke was processed. Here are the supported
special keystrokes:

  Keystroke                       Action
  ------------------------------- -------------------------------------------
  `Control-A`

  `Control-B`                     appropriate.

  `Control-D`

  `Control-E`                     of line (stripspaces on).

  `Control-F`                     appropriate.

  `Control-G`

  `Control-H`

  `Control-J`                     otherwise move to the start of the next
                                  line.

  `Control-K`                     clear to end of line.

  `Control-L`

  `Control-N`

  `Control-O`

  `Control-P`

Move operations do nothing if the cursor is at an edge where the
movement is not possible. The following synonyms are supported where
possible:

  Constant                                    Keystroke

:::

::: method
gather()

Return the window contents as a string; whether blanks in the window are
included is affected by the `stripspaces`
member.
:::

::: attribute
stripspaces

This attribute is a flag which controls the interpretation of blanks in
the window. When it is on, trailing blanks on each line are ignored; any
cursor motion that would land the cursor on a trailing blank goes to the
end of that line instead, and trailing blanks are stripped when the
window contents are gathered.
