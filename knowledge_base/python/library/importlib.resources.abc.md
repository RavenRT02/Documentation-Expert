::::::::: ResourceReader
*Superseded by TraversableResources*

An `abstract base class` to provide the
ability to read *resources*.

From the perspective of this ABC, a *resource* is a binary artifact that
is shipped within a package. Typically this is something like a data
file that lives next to the `__init__.py` file of the package. The
purpose of this class is to help abstract out the accessing of such data
files so that it does not matter if the package and its data file(s) are
stored e.g. in a zip file versus on the file system.

For any of methods of this class, a *resource* argument is expected to
be a `path-like object` which represents
conceptually just a file name. This means that no subdirectory paths
should be included in the *resource* argument. This is because the
location of the package the reader is for, acts as the \"directory\".
Hence the metaphor for directories and file names is packages and
resources, respectively. This is also why instances of this class are
expected to directly correlate to a specific package (instead of
potentially representing multiple packages or a module).

Loaders that wish to support resource reading are expected to provide a
method called `get_resource_reader(fullname)` which returns an object
implementing this ABC\'s interface. If the module specified by fullname
is not a package, this method should return `None`. An object compatible with this ABC should only be
returned when the specified module is a package.

::: deprecated
3.12 Use
`importlib.resources.abc.TraversableResources` instead.
:::

::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
open_resource(resource)

Returns an opened, `file-like object` for
binary reading of the *resource*.

If the resource cannot be found, `FileNotFoundError` is raised.
:::

::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
resource_path(resource)

Returns the file system path to the *resource*.

If the resource does not concretely exist on the file system, raise
`FileNotFoundError`.
:::

:::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
is_resource(path)

Returns `True` if the named *path* is considered a resource.
`FileNotFoundError` is raised if *path*
does not exist.

::: versionchanged
3.10 The argument *name* was renamed to *path*.
:::
::::

::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
contents()

Returns an `iterable` of strings over the
contents of the package. Do note that it is not required that all names
returned by the iterator be actual resources, e.g. it is acceptable to
return names for which `is_resource`
would be false.

Allowing non-resource names to be returned is to allow for situations
where how a package and its resources are stored are known a priori and
the non-resource names would be useful. For instance, returning
subdirectory names is allowed so that when it is known that the package
and resources are stored on the file system then those subdirectory
names can be used directly.

The abstract method returns an iterable of no items.
:::
:::::::::

::::::::::::: Traversable
An object with a subset of `pathlib.Path` methods suitable for traversing directories and opening
files.

For a representation of the object on the file-system, use
`importlib.resources.as_file`.

::: attribute
name

Abstract. The base name of this object without any parent references.
:::

::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
iterdir()

Yield Traversable objects in self.
:::

::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
is_dir()

Return `True` if self is a directory.
:::

::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
is_file()

Return `True` if self is a file.
:::

:::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
joinpath(\*pathsegments)

Traverse directories according to *pathsegments* and return the result
as `!Traversable`.

Each *pathsegments* argument may contain multiple names separated by
forward slashes (`/`, `posixpath.sep` ). For example, the following are
equivalent:

    files.joinpath('subdir', 'subsuddir', 'file.txt')
    files.joinpath('subdir/subsuddir/file.txt')

Note that some `!Traversable`
implementations might not be updated to the latest version of the
protocol. For compatibility with such implementations, provide a single
argument without path separators to each call to `joinpath`. For
example:

    files.joinpath('subdir').joinpath('subsubdir').joinpath('file.txt')

::: versionchanged
3.11

`joinpath` accepts multiple *pathsegments*, and these segments may
contain forward slashes as path separators. Previously, only a single
*child* argument was accepted.
:::
::::

::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
\_\_truediv\_\_(child)

Return Traversable child in self. Equivalent to `joinpath(child)`.
:::

::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
open(mode=\'r\', *args,*\*kwargs)

*mode* may be \'r\' or \'rb\' to open as text or binary. Return a handle
suitable for reading (same as `pathlib.Path.open`).

When opening as text, accepts encoding parameters such as those accepted
by `io.TextIOWrapper`.
:::

::: method
read_bytes()

Read contents of self as bytes.
:::

::: method
read_text(encoding=None)

Read contents of self as text.
:::
:::::::::::::

:::: TraversableResources
An abstract base class for resource readers capable of serving the
`importlib.resources.files` interface.
Subclasses `ResourceReader` and provides
concrete implementations of the `!ResourceReader`\'s abstract methods. Therefore, any loader supplying
`!TraversableResources` also supplies
`!ResourceReader`.

Loaders that wish to support resource reading are expected to implement
this interface.

::: {.method abstractmethod=""}
files()

Returns a `importlib.resources.abc.Traversable` object for the loaded package.
