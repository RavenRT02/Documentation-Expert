# `!gzip` \-\-- Support for `gzip` files

::: {.module synopsis="Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects."}
gzip
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/gzip.py`

This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files
just like the GNU programs `gzip` and
`gunzip` would.

This is an `optional module`. If it is
missing from your copy of CPython, look for documentation from your
distributor (that is, whoever provided Python to you). If you are the
distributor, see `optional-module-requirements`.

The data compression is provided by the `zlib` module.

The `!gzip` module provides the
`GzipFile` class, as well as the
`.open`, `compress` and `decompress` convenience
functions. The `GzipFile` class reads
and writes `gzip`-format files,
automatically compressing or decompressing the data so that it looks
like an ordinary `file object`.

Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the
`gzip` and `gunzip` programs, such as those produced by
`compress` and
`pack`, are not supported by this
module.

The module defines the following items:

:::::::: function
open(filename, mode=\'rb\', compresslevel=6, encoding=None, errors=None,
newline=None, \*, mtime=None)

Open a gzip-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a `file
object`.

The *filename* argument can be an actual filename (a
`str` or `bytes` object), or an existing file object to read from or write
to.

The *mode* argument can be any of `'r'`, `'rb'`, `'a'`, `'ab'`, `'w'`,
`'wb'`, `'x'` or `'xb'` for binary mode, or `'rt'`, `'at'`, `'wt'`, or
`'xt'` for text mode. The default is `'rb'`.

The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from 0 to 9, as for the
`GzipFile` constructor.

The keyword-only argument *mtime* represents a Unix timestamp.

For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the
`GzipFile` constructor:
`GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel, mtime=mtime)`. In this case,
the *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments must not be provided.

For text mode, a `GzipFile` object is
created, and wrapped in an `io.TextIOWrapper` instance with the specified encoding, error handling
behavior, and line ending(s).

::: versionchanged
3.3 Added support for *filename* being a file object, support for text
mode, and the *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.4 Added support for the `'x'`, `'xb'` and `'xt'` modes.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.6 Accepts a `path-like object`.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.15 The default compression level was reduced to 6 (down from 9). It is
the default level used by most compression tools and a better tradeoff
between speed and performance.
:::

::: versionchanged
next Added keyword-only argument *mtime* which is passed to the class
constructor of `~gzip.GzipFile`.
:::
::::::::

:::: exception
BadGzipFile

An exception raised for invalid gzip files. It inherits from
`OSError`. `EOFError` and `zlib.error` can also be
raised for invalid gzip files.

::: versionadded
3.8

::::

:::::::::::::::::::: {.GzipFile(filename=None, .mode=None, .compresslevel=6, .fileobj=None, .mtime=None)}
Constructor for the `GzipFile` class,
which simulates most of the methods of a `file object`, with the exception of the
`~io.IOBase.truncate` method. At least
one of *fileobj* and *filename* must be given a non-trivial value.

The new class instance is based on *fileobj*, which can be a regular
file, an `io.BytesIO` object, or any
other object which simulates a file. It defaults to `None`, in which
case *filename* is opened to provide a file object.

When *fileobj* is not `None`, the *filename* argument is only used to be
included in the `gzip` file header,
which may include the original filename of the uncompressed file. It
defaults to the filename of *fileobj*, if discernible; otherwise, it
defaults to the empty string, and in this case the original filename is
not included in the header.

The *mode* argument can be any of `'r'`, `'rb'`, `'a'`, `'ab'`, `'w'`,
`'wb'`, `'x'`, or `'xb'`, depending on whether the file will be read or
written. The default is the mode of *fileobj* if discernible; otherwise,
the default is `'rb'`. In future Python releases the mode of *fileobj*
will not be used. It is better to always specify *mode* for writing.

Note that the file is always opened in binary mode. To open a compressed
file in text mode, use `.open` (or wrap
your `GzipFile` with an
`io.TextIOWrapper`).

The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from `0` to `9` controlling
the level of compression; `1` is fastest and produces the least
compression, and `9` is slowest and produces the most compression. `0`
is no compression. The default is `9`.

The optional *mtime* argument is the timestamp requested by gzip. The
time is in Unix format, i.e., seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1,
1970. Set *mtime* to `0` to generate a compressed stream that does not
depend on creation time. If *mtime* is omitted or `None`, the current
time is used; however, if the current time is outside the range 00:00:00
UTC, January 1, 1970 through 06:28:15 UTC, February 7, 2106, or
explicitly passed *mtime* argument is outside the range `0` to
`2**32-1`, then the value `0` is used instead.

See below for the `mtime` attribute that
is set when decompressing.

Calling a `GzipFile` object\'s
`!close` method does not close *fileobj*,
since you might wish to append more material after the compressed data.
This also allows you to pass an `io.BytesIO` object opened for writing as *fileobj*, and retrieve the
resulting memory buffer using the `io.BytesIO` object\'s `~io.BytesIO.getvalue` method.

`GzipFile` supports the
`io.BufferedIOBase` interface, including
iteration and the `with` statement.
Only the `~io.IOBase.truncate` method
isn\'t implemented.

`GzipFile` also provides the following
method and attribute:

:::::: method
peek(n)

Read *n* uncompressed bytes without advancing the file position. The
number of bytes returned may be more or less than requested.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

While calling `peek` does not change the
file position of the `GzipFile`, it may
change the position of the underlying file object (e.g. if the
`GzipFile` was constructed with the
*fileobj* parameter).
::::

::: versionadded
3.2
:::
::::::

:::: attribute
mode

`'rb'` for reading and `'wb'` for writing.

::: versionchanged
3.13 In previous versions it was an integer `1` or `2`.
:::
::::

::: attribute
mtime

When decompressing, this attribute is set to the last timestamp in the
most recently read header. It is an integer, holding the number of
seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970). The
initial value before reading any headers is `None`.
:::

::: attribute
name

The path to the gzip file on disk, as a `str` or `bytes`. Equivalent to
the output of `os.fspath` on the original
input path, with no other normalization, resolution or expansion.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.1 Support for the `with` statement
was added, along with the *mtime* constructor argument and
`mtime` attribute.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.2 Support for zero-padded and unseekable files was added.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.3 The `io.BufferedIOBase.read1` method
is now implemented.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.4 Added support for the `'x'` and `'xb'` modes.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.5 Added support for writing arbitrary
`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>`.
The `~io.BufferedIOBase.read` method now
accepts an argument of `None`.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.6 Accepts a `path-like object`.
:::

::: deprecated
3.9 Opening `GzipFile` for writing
without specifying the *mode* argument is deprecated.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.12 Remove the `filename` attribute, use the
`~GzipFile.name` attribute instead.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.15 The default compression level was reduced to 6 (down from 9). It is
the default level used by most compression tools and a better tradeoff
between speed and performance.
:::
::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::: function
compress(data, compresslevel=6, \*, mtime=0)

Compress the *data*, returning a `bytes`
object containing the compressed data. *compresslevel* and *mtime* have
the same meaning as in the `GzipFile`
constructor above, but *mtime* defaults to 0 for reproducible output.

::: versionadded
3.2
:::

::: versionchanged
3.8 Added the *mtime* parameter for reproducible output.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.11 Speed is improved by compressing all data at once instead of in a
streamed fashion. Calls with *mtime* set to `0` are delegated to
`zlib.compress` for better speed. In this
situation the output may contain a gzip header \"OS\" byte value other
than 255 \"unknown\" as supplied by the underlying zlib implementation.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.13 The gzip header OS byte is guaranteed to be set to 255 when this
function is used as was the case in 3.10 and earlier.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.14 The *mtime* parameter now defaults to 0 for reproducible output.
For the previous behaviour of using the current time, pass `None` to
*mtime*.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.15 The default compression level was reduced to 6 (down from 9). It is
the default level used by most compression tools and a better tradeoff
between speed and performance.
:::
:::::::::

::::: function
decompress(data)

Decompress the *data*, returning a `bytes` object containing the uncompressed data. This function is
capable of decompressing multi-member gzip data (multiple gzip blocks
concatenated together). When the data is certain to contain only one
member the `zlib.decompress` function
with *wbits* set to 31 is faster.

::: versionadded
3.2
:::

::: versionchanged
3.11 Speed is improved by decompressing members at once in memory
instead of in a streamed fashion.

## Examples of usage {#gzip-usage-examples}

Example of how to read a compressed file:

    import gzip
    with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'rb') as f:
        file_content = f.read()

Example of how to create a compressed GZIP file:

    import gzip
    content = b"Lots of content here"
    with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(content)

Example of how to GZIP compress an existing file:

    import gzip
    import shutil
    with open('/home/joe/file.txt', 'rb') as f_in:
        with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'wb') as f_out:
            shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)

Example of how to GZIP compress a binary string:

    import gzip
    s_in = b"Lots of content here"
    s_out = gzip.compress(s_in)

Module `zlib`

: The basic data compression module needed to support the
  `gzip` file format.

In case gzip (de)compression is a bottleneck, the
[python-isal](https://github.com/pycompression/python-isal) package
speeds up (de)compression with a mostly compatible API.
