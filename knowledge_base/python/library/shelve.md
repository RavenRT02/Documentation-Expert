# `!shelve` \-\-- Python object persistence

::: {.module synopsis="Python object persistence."}
shelve
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/shelve.py`

A \"shelf\" is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with
\"dbm\" databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be
essentially arbitrary Python objects \-\-- anything that the
`pickle` module can handle. This includes
most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing lots
of shared sub-objects. The keys are ordinary strings.

:::::::: function
open(filename, flag=\'c\', protocol=None, writeback=False, \*,
serializer=None, deserializer=None)

Open a persistent dictionary. The filename specified is the base
filename for the underlying database. As a side-effect, an extension may
be added to the filename and more than one file may be created. By
default, the underlying database file is opened for reading and writing.
The optional *flag* parameter has the same interpretation as the *flag*
parameter of `dbm.open`.

By default, pickles created with
`pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` are used to
serialize values. The version of the pickle protocol can be specified
with the *protocol* parameter.

Because of Python semantics, a shelf cannot know when a mutable
persistent-dictionary entry is modified. By default modified objects are
written *only* when assigned to the shelf (see
`shelve-example`). If the optional
*writeback* parameter is set to `True`, all entries accessed are also
cached in memory, and written back on `~Shelf.sync` and `~Shelf.close`; this can
make it handier to mutate mutable entries in the persistent dictionary,
but, if many entries are accessed, it can consume vast amounts of memory
for the cache, and it can make the close operation very slow since all
accessed entries are written back (there is no way to determine which
accessed entries are mutable, nor which ones were actually mutated).

By default, `!shelve` uses
`pickle.dumps` and
`pickle.loads` for serializing and
deserializing. This can be changed by supplying *serializer* and
*deserializer*, respectively.

The *serializer* argument must be a callable which takes an object `obj`
and the *protocol* as inputs and returns the representation `obj` as a
`bytes-like object`; the *protocol* value
may be ignored by the serializer.

The *deserializer* argument must be a callable which takes a serialized
object given as a `bytes` object and
returns the corresponding object.

A `ShelveError` is raised if *serializer*
is given but *deserializer* is not, or vice-versa.

Note

Do not rely on the shelf being closed automatically; always call
`~Shelf.close` explicitly when you don\'t
need it any more, or use `shelve.open` as
a context manager:

    with shelve.open('spam') as db:
        db['eggs'] = 'eggs'

Warning
:::

Because the `!shelve` module is backed by
`pickle`, it is insecure to load a shelf
from an untrusted source. Like with pickle, loading a shelf can execute
arbitrary code.
::::
:::::

Shelf objects support most of the methods and operations supported by
dictionaries (except copying, constructors and operators `|` and `|=`).
This eases the transition from dictionary based scripts to those
requiring persistent storage.

Two additional methods are supported:

::: method
Shelf.sync()

Write back all entries in the cache if the shelf was opened with
*writeback* set to `True`. Also empty
the cache and synchronize the persistent dictionary on disk, if
feasible. This is called automatically when
`reorganize` is called or the shelf is
closed with `close`.
:::

:::: method
Shelf.reorganize()

Calls `sync` and attempts to shrink space
used on disk by removing empty space resulting from deletions.

::: versionadded
3.15
:::
::::

::: method
Shelf.close()

Synchronize and close the persistent *dict* object. Operations on a
closed shelf will fail with a `ValueError`.

## Restrictions

- The choice of which database package will be used (such as
  `dbm.ndbm` or
  `dbm.gnu`) depends on which interface is
  available. Therefore it is not safe to open the database directly
  using `dbm`. The database is also
  (unfortunately) subject to the limitations of `dbm`, if it is used \-\-- this means that (the pickled
  representation of) the objects stored in the database should be fairly
  small, and in rare cases key collisions may cause the database to
  refuse updates.
- The `!shelve` module does not support
  *concurrent* read/write access to shelved objects. (Multiple
  simultaneous read accesses are safe.) When a program has a shelf open
  for writing, no other program should have it open for reading or
  writing. Unix file locking can be used to solve this, but this differs
  across Unix versions and requires knowledge about the database
  implementation used.
- On macOS `dbm.ndbm` can silently corrupt
  the database file on updates, which can cause hard crashes when trying
  to read from the database.
- `Shelf.reorganize` may not be available
  for all database packages and may temporarily increase resource usage
  (especially disk space) when called. Additionally, it will never run
  automatically and instead needs to be called explicitly.

::::::: {.Shelf(dict, .protocol=None, .writeback=False, .\\ .keyencoding='utf-8', .*, .serializer=None, .deserializer=None)}
A subclass of `collections.abc.MutableMapping` which stores pickled values in the *dict* object.

By default, pickles created with
`pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` are used to
serialize values. The version of the pickle protocol can be specified
with the *protocol* parameter. See the `pickle` documentation for a discussion of the pickle protocols.

If the *writeback* parameter is `True`, the object will hold a cache of
all entries accessed and write them back to the *dict* at sync and close
times. This allows natural operations on mutable entries, but can
consume much more memory and make sync and close take a long time.

The *keyencoding* parameter is the encoding used to encode keys before
they are used with the underlying dict.

The *serializer* and *deserializer* parameters have the same
interpretation as in `~shelve.open`.

A `Shelf` object can also be used as a
context manager, in which case it will be automatically closed when the
`with` block ends.

:::
:::::::

:::: {.BsdDbShelf(dict, .protocol=None, .writeback=False, .\\ .keyencoding='utf-8', .*, .\\ .serializer=None, .deserializer=None)}
A subclass of `Shelf` which exposes
`!first`, `!next`, `!previous`,
`!last` and
`!set_location` methods. These are
available in the third-party `!bsddb`
module from [pybsddb](https://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm) but
not in other database modules. The *dict* object passed to the
constructor must support those methods. This is generally accomplished
by calling one of `!bsddb.hashopen`,
`!bsddb.btopen` or
`!bsddb.rnopen`. The optional *protocol*,
*writeback*, *keyencoding*, *serializer* and *deserializer* parameters
have the same interpretation as in `~shelve.open`.

::: versionchanged
3.15 Added the *serializer* and *deserializer* parameters.
:::
::::

:::: {.DbfilenameShelf(filename, .flag='c', .protocol=None, .\\ .writeback=False, .*, .serializer=None, .\\ .deserializer=None)}
A subclass of `Shelf` which accepts a
*filename* instead of a dict-like object. The underlying file will be
opened using `dbm.open`. By default, the
file will be created and opened for both read and write. The optional
*flag* parameter has the same interpretation as for the
`.open` function. The optional
*protocol*, *writeback*, *serializer* and *deserializer* parameters have
the same interpretation as in `~shelve.open`.

::: versionchanged
3.15 Added the *serializer* and *deserializer* parameters.

## Example {#shelve-example}

To summarize the interface (`key` is a string, `data` is an arbitrary
object):

    import shelve

    d = shelve.open(filename)  # open -- file may get suffix added by low-level
                               # library

    d[key] = data              # store data at key (overwrites old data if
                               # using an existing key)
    data = d[key]              # retrieve a COPY of data at key (raise KeyError
                               # if no such key)
    del d[key]                 # delete data stored at key (raises KeyError
                               # if no such key)

    flag = key in d            # true if the key exists
    klist = list(d.keys())     # a list of all existing keys (slow!)

    # as d was opened WITHOUT writeback=True, beware:
    d['xx'] = [0, 1, 2]        # this works as expected, but...
    d['xx'].append(3)          # *this doesn't!* -- d['xx'] is STILL [0, 1, 2]!

    # having opened d without writeback=True, you need to code carefully:
    temp = d['xx']             # extracts the copy
    temp.append(5)             # mutates the copy
    d['xx'] = temp             # stores the copy right back, to persist it

    # or, d=shelve.open(filename,writeback=True) would let you just code
    # d['xx'].append(5) and have it work as expected, BUT it would also
    # consume more memory and make the d.close() operation slower.

    d.close()                  # close it

## Exceptions

:::: exception
ShelveError

Exception raised when one of the arguments *deserializer* and
*serializer* is missing in the `~shelve.open`, `Shelf`,
`BsdDbShelf` and
`DbfilenameShelf`.

The *deserializer* and *serializer* arguments must be given together.
