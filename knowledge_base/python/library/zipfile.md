# `!zipfile` \-\-- Work with ZIP archives

::: {.module synopsis="Read and write ZIP-format archive files."}
zipfile
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/zipfile/`

The ZIP file format is a common archive and compression standard. This
module provides tools to create, read, write, append, and list a ZIP
file. Any advanced use of this module will require an understanding of
the format, as defined in [PKZIP Application
Note](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT).

This module does not handle multipart ZIP files. It can handle ZIP files
that use the ZIP64 extensions (that is ZIP files that are more than 4
GiB in size). It supports decryption of encrypted files in ZIP archives,
but it cannot create an encrypted file. Decryption is extremely slow as
it is implemented in native Python rather than C.

Handling compressed archives requires
`optional modules <optional module>` such
as `zlib`, `bz2`, `lzma`, and
`compression.zstd`. If any of them are
missing from your copy of CPython, look for documentation from your
distributor (that is, whoever provided Python to you). If you are the
distributor, see `optional-module-requirements`.

The module defines the following items:

:::: exception
BadZipFile

The error raised for bad ZIP files.

::: versionadded
3.2

:::: exception
BadZipfile

Alias of `BadZipFile`, for compatibility
with older Python versions.

LargeZipFile

The error raised when a ZIP file would require ZIP64 functionality but
that has not been enabled.
:::

::: {.ZipFile noindex=""}
The class for reading and writing ZIP files. See section
`zipfile-objects` for constructor details.
:::

:::: {.Path noindex=""}
Class that implements a subset of the interface provided by
`pathlib.Path`, including the full
`importlib.resources.abc.Traversable`
interface.

::: {.PyZipFile noindex=""}
Class for creating ZIP archives containing Python libraries.
:::

:::::: {.ZipInfo(filename='NoName', .date_time=(1980,1,1,0,0,0))}
Class used to represent information about a member of an archive.
Instances of this class are returned by the `.getinfo` and `.infolist` methods of
`ZipFile` objects. Most users of the
`!zipfile` module will not need to create
these, but only use those created by this module. *filename* should be
the full name of the archive member, and *date_time* should be a tuple
containing six fields which describe the time of the last modification
to the file; the fields are described in section
`zipinfo-objects`.

::: versionchanged
3.13 A public `!compress_level` attribute
has been added to expose the formerly protected
`!_compresslevel`. The older protected
name continues to work as a property for backwards compatibility.
:::

:::: method
[for_archive]{#for_archive}(archive)

Resolve the date_time, compression attributes, and external attributes
to suitable defaults as used by `ZipFile.writestr`.

Returns self for chaining.

In APPNOTE 6.3.7, the method ID `20` was assigned to Zstandard
compression. This was changed in APPNOTE 6.3.8 to method ID `93` to

The ZIP file format specification has included support for bzip2
compression since 2001, for LZMA compression since 2006, and Zstandard
compression since 2020. However, some tools (including older Python
releases) do not support these compression methods, and may either
refuse to process the ZIP file altogether, or fail to extract individual
files.

## ZipFile objects

:::::::::::::: {.ZipFile(file, .mode='r', .compression=ZIP_STORED, .allowZip64=True, .\\ .compresslevel=None, .*, .strict_timestamps=True, .\\ .metadata_encoding=None)}
Open a ZIP file, where *file* can be a path to a file (a string), a
file-like object or a `path-like object`.

The *mode* parameter should be `'r'` to read an existing file, `'w'` to
truncate and write a new file, `'a'` to append to an existing file, or
`'x'` to exclusively create and write a new file. If *mode* is `'x'` and
*file* refers to an existing file, a `FileExistsError` will be raised. If *mode* is `'a'` and *file* refers to an
existing ZIP file, then additional files are added to it. If *file* does
not refer to a ZIP file, then a new ZIP archive is appended to the file.
This is meant for adding a ZIP archive to another file (such as
`python.exe`). If *mode* is `'a'` and the
file does not exist at all, it is created. If *mode* is `'r'` or `'a'`,
the file should be seekable.

*compression* is the ZIP compression method to use when writing the
archive, and should be `ZIP_STORED`,
`ZIP_DEFLATED`,
`ZIP_BZIP2`,
`ZIP_LZMA`, or
`ZIP_ZSTANDARD`; unrecognized values
will cause `NotImplementedError` to be
raised. If `ZIP_DEFLATED`,
`ZIP_BZIP2`,
`ZIP_LZMA`, or
`ZIP_ZSTANDARD` is specified but the
corresponding module (`zlib`,
`bz2`, `lzma`, or `compression.zstd`) is not
available, `RuntimeError` is raised. The
default is `ZIP_STORED`.

If *allowZip64* is `True` (the default) zipfile will create ZIP files
that use the ZIP64 extensions when the zipfile is larger than 4 GiB. If
it is `false` `!zipfile` will raise an
exception when the ZIP file would require ZIP64 extensions.

The *compresslevel* parameter controls the compression level to use when
writing files to the archive. When using `ZIP_STORED` or `ZIP_LZMA` it has no
effect. When using `ZIP_DEFLATED`
integers `0` through `9` are accepted (see
`zlib <zlib.compressobj>` for more
information). When using `ZIP_BZIP2`
integers `1` through `9` are accepted (see
`bz2 <bz2.BZ2File>` for more
information). When using `ZIP_ZSTANDARD`
integers `-131072` through `22` are commonly accepted (see
`CompressionParameter.compression_level <compression.zstd.CompressionParameter.compression_level>` for more on retrieving valid values and their meaning).

The *strict_timestamps* argument, when set to `False`, allows to zip
files older than 1980-01-01 at the cost of setting the timestamp to
1980-01-01. Similar behavior occurs with files newer than 2107-12-31,
the timestamp is also set to the limit.

When mode is `'r'`, *metadata_encoding* may be set to the name of a
codec, which will be used to decode metadata such as the names of
members and ZIP comments.

If the file is created with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'` and then
`closed <close>` without adding any files
to the archive, the appropriate ZIP structures for an empty archive will
be written to the file.

ZipFile is also a context manager and therefore supports the
`with` statement. In the example,
*myzip* is closed after the `!with`
statement\'s suite is finished\-\--even if an exception occurs:

    with ZipFile('spam.zip', 'w') as myzip:
        myzip.write('eggs.txt')

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

*metadata_encoding* is an instance-wide setting for the ZipFile. It is
not possible to set this on a per-member basis.

This attribute is a workaround for legacy implementations which produce
archives with names in the current locale encoding or code page (mostly
on Windows). According to the .ZIP standard, the encoding of metadata
may be specified to be either IBM code page (default) or UTF-8 by a flag
in the archive header. That flag takes precedence over
*metadata_encoding*, which is a Python-specific extension.

:::
::::::::::::::

::: method
ZipFile.close()

Close the archive file. You must call `close` before exiting your program or essential records will not
be written.
:::

::: method
ZipFile.getinfo(name)

Return a `ZipInfo` object with
information about the archive member *name*. Calling
`getinfo` for a name not currently
contained in the archive will raise a `KeyError`.
:::

::: method
ZipFile.infolist()

Return a list containing a `ZipInfo`
object for each member of the archive. The objects are in the same order
as their entries in the actual ZIP file on disk if an existing archive
was opened.
:::

::: method
ZipFile.namelist()

Return a list of archive members by name.
:::

::::::::: method
ZipFile.open(name, mode=\'r\', pwd=None, \*, force_zip64=False)

Access a member of the archive as a binary file-like object. *name* can
be either the name of a file within the archive or a
`ZipInfo` object. The *mode* parameter,
if included, must be `'r'` (the default) or `'w'`. *pwd* is the password
used to decrypt encrypted ZIP files as a `bytes` object.

`~ZipFile.open` is also a context manager
and therefore supports the `with`
statement:

    with ZipFile('spam.zip') as myzip:
        with myzip.open('eggs.txt') as myfile:
            print(myfile.read())

With *mode* `'r'` the file-like object (`ZipExtFile`) is read-only and
provides the following methods:
`~io.BufferedIOBase.read`,
`~io.IOBase.readline`,
`~io.IOBase.readlines`,
`~io.IOBase.seek`,
`~io.IOBase.tell`,
`~container.__iter__`,
`~iterator.__next__`. These objects can
operate independently of the ZipFile.

With `mode='w'`, a writable file handle is returned, which supports the
`~io.BufferedIOBase.write` method. While
a writable file handle is open, attempting to read or write other files
in the ZIP file will raise a `ValueError`.

In both cases the file-like object has also attributes
`!name`, which is equivalent to the name
of a file within the archive, and `!mode`, which is `'rb'` or `'wb'` depending on the input mode.

When writing a file, if the file size is not known in advance but may
exceed 2 GiB, pass `force_zip64=True` to ensure that the header format
is capable of supporting large files. If the file size is known in
advance, construct a `ZipInfo` object
with `~ZipInfo.file_size` set, and use
that as the *name* parameter.

:::: note

The `.open`, `read` and `extract` methods can
take a filename or a `ZipInfo` object.
You will appreciate this when trying to read a ZIP file that contains
members with duplicate names.

3.6 Removed support of `mode='U'`. Use
`io.TextIOWrapper` for reading
compressed text files in `universal newlines` mode.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.6 `ZipFile.open` can now be used to
write files into the archive with the `mode='w'` option.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.6 Calling `.open` on a closed ZipFile
will raise a `ValueError`. Previously, a
`RuntimeError` was raised.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.13 Added attributes `!name` and
`!mode` for the writeable file-like
object. The value of the `!mode`
attribute for the readable file-like object was changed from `'r'` to
`'rb'`.
:::
:::::::::

::::::: method
ZipFile.extract(member, path=None, pwd=None)

Extract a member from the archive to the current working directory;
*member* must be its full name or a `ZipInfo` object. Its file information is extracted as accurately as
possible. *path* specifies a different directory to extract to. *member*
can be a filename or a `ZipInfo` object.
*pwd* is the password used for encrypted files as a
`bytes` object.

Returns the normalized path created (a directory or new file).

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a member filename is an absolute path, a drive/UNC sharepoint and
leading (back)slashes will be stripped, e.g.: `///foo/bar` becomes
`foo/bar` on Unix, and `C:\foo\bar` becomes `foo\bar` on Windows. And
all `".."` components in a member filename will be removed, e.g.:
`../../foo../../ba..r` becomes `foo../ba..r`. On Windows illegal
characters (`:`, `<`, `>`, `|`, `"`, `?`, and `*`) replaced by
underscore (`_`).

3.6 Calling `extract` on a closed ZipFile
will raise a `ValueError`. Previously, a

:::::::

::::::: method
ZipFile.extractall(path=None, members=None, pwd=None)

Extract all members from the archive to the current working directory.
*path* specifies a different directory to extract to. *members* is
optional and must be a subset of the list returned by
`namelist`. *pwd* is the password used
for encrypted files as a `bytes` object.

:::: warning

Warning
:::

Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection.
It is possible that files are created outside of *path*, for example,
members that have absolute filenames or filenames with \"..\"
components. This module attempts to prevent that. See
`extract` note.

:::

::: method
ZipFile.setpassword(pwd)

Set *pwd* (a `bytes` object) as default
password to extract encrypted files.
:::

:::: method
ZipFile.read(name, pwd=None)

Return the bytes of the file *name* in the archive. *name* is the name
of the file in the archive, or a `ZipInfo` object. The archive must be open for read or append. *pwd*
is the password used for encrypted files as a `bytes` object and, if specified, overrides the default password
set with `setpassword`. Calling
`read` on a ZipFile that uses a
compression method other than `ZIP_STORED`, `ZIP_DEFLATED`,
`ZIP_BZIP2`,
`ZIP_LZMA`, or
`ZIP_ZSTANDARD` will raise a
`NotImplementedError`. An error will also
be raised if the corresponding compression module is not available.

::: versionchanged
3.6 Calling `read` on a closed ZipFile
will raise a `ValueError`. Previously, a
`RuntimeError` was raised.

headers. Return the name of the first bad file, or else return `None`.

::: versionchanged
3.6 Calling `testzip` on a closed ZipFile
will raise a `ValueError`. Previously, a
`RuntimeError` was raised.
:::
::::

:::::::::::: method
ZipFile.write(filename, arcname=None, compress_type=None,
compresslevel=None)

Write the file named *filename* to the archive, giving it the archive
name *arcname* (by default, this will be the same as *filename*, but
without a drive letter and with leading path separators removed). If
given, *compress_type* overrides the value given for the *compression*
parameter to the constructor for the new entry. Similarly,
*compresslevel* will override the constructor if given. The archive must
be open with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'`.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The ZIP file standard historically did not specify a metadata encoding,
but strongly recommended CP437 (the original IBM PC encoding) for
interoperability. Recent versions allow use of UTF-8 (only). In this
module, UTF-8 will automatically be used to write the member names if
they contain any non-ASCII characters. It is not possible to write
member names in any encoding other than ASCII or UTF-8.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Archive names should be relative to the archive root, that is, they
should not start with a path separator.
::::

:::: note

Note
:::

If `arcname` (or `filename`, if `arcname` is not given) contains a null
byte, the name of the file in the archive will be truncated at the null
byte.

A leading slash in the filename may lead to the archive being impossible
to open in some zip programs on Windows systems.

3.6 Calling `write` on a ZipFile created
with mode `'r'` or a closed ZipFile will raise a
`ValueError`. Previously, a
`RuntimeError` was raised.
:::
::::::::::::

:::::::: method
ZipFile.writestr(zinfo_or_arcname, data, compress_type=None,
compresslevel=None)

Write a file into the archive. The contents is *data*, which may be
either a `str` or a
`bytes` instance; if it is a
`str`, it is encoded as UTF-8 first.
*zinfo_or_arcname* is either the file name it will be given in the
archive, or a `ZipInfo` instance. If
it\'s an instance, at least the filename, date, and time must be given.
If it\'s a name, the date and time is set to the current date and time.
The archive must be opened with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'`.

If given, *compress_type* overrides the value given for the
*compression* parameter to the constructor for the new entry, or in the
*zinfo_or_arcname* (if that is a `ZipInfo` instance). Similarly, *compresslevel* will override the
constructor if given.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

When passing a `ZipInfo` instance as the
*zinfo_or_arcname* parameter, the compression method used will be that
specified in the *compress_type* member of the given
`ZipInfo` instance. By default, the
`ZipInfo` constructor sets this member
to `ZIP_STORED`.

3.14 Now respects the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable. If set, it uses this value as the
modification timestamp for the file written into the ZIP archive,
instead of using the current time.
:::
::::::::

:::: method
ZipFile.mkdir(zinfo_or_directory, mode=511)

Create a directory inside the archive. If *zinfo_or_directory* is a
string, a directory is created inside the archive with the mode that is
specified in the *mode* argument. If, however, *zinfo_or_directory* is a
`ZipInfo` instance then the *mode*
argument is ignored.

The archive must be opened with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'`.

::: versionadded
3.11
:::
::::

:::::: method
ZipFile.remove(zinfo_or_arcname)

Removes a member entry from the archive\'s central directory.
*zinfo_or_arcname* may be the full path of the member or a
`ZipInfo` instance. If multiple members
share the same full path and the path is given as a string, only one of
them is removed and which one is unspecified; it should not be relied
upon. Pass the specific `ZipInfo`
instance to remove a particular member.

The archive must be opened with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'`.

Returns the removed `ZipInfo` instance.

Calling `remove` on a closed ZipFile will
raise a `ValueError`.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This method only removes the member\'s entry from the central directory,
making it inaccessible to most tools. The member\'s local file entry,
including content and metadata, remains in the archive and is still
recoverable using forensic tools. Call `repack` afterwards to remove the local file entry and reclaim
space; pass the returned `ZipInfo` to
`repack` to ensure the data is removed
regardless of how the entry was written.
::::

::: versionadded
next
:::
::::::

:::::: method
ZipFile.repack(removed=None, \*, strict_descriptor=True\[, chunk_size\])

Rewrites the archive to remove unreferenced local file entries,
shrinking its file size. The archive must be opened with mode `'a'`.

If *removed* is provided, it must be a sequence of
`ZipInfo` objects representing the
recently removed members, and only their corresponding local file
entries will be removed. Otherwise, the archive is scanned to locate and
remove local file entries that are no longer referenced in the central
directory.

Passing *removed* is the most reliable way to reclaim space: the
corresponding local file entries are located directly from the central
directory and removed regardless of how they were written, whereas the
scan used when *removed* is omitted may leave some entries in place (see
*strict_descriptor* below). To remove members and reclaim their space in
a single step:

    with ZipFile('spam.zip', 'a') as myzip:
        removed = [myzip.remove(name) for name in ('ham.txt', 'eggs.txt')]
        myzip.repack(removed)

When scanning, *strict_descriptor* controls how entries written with an
unsigned *data descriptor* are handled. A data descriptor is an optional
record holding an entry\'s CRC and sizes, stored just after the entry\'s
data; it is used when the archive is written to a non-seekable stream,
and is *signed* when it begins with a marker signature or *unsigned*
otherwise. Unsigned descriptors have been deprecated by the [PKZIP
Application
Note](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT) since
version 6.3.0 (released in 2006) and are written only by some legacy
tools; signed descriptors---written by Python and other modern
tools---are always detected. When *strict_descriptor* is true (the
default), only signed data descriptors are detected, so an unreferenced
entry written with an unsigned descriptor is not located and its space
is not reclaimed by the scan. Setting `strict_descriptor=False`
additionally detects unsigned descriptors, at the cost of a
significantly slower scan---around 100 to 1000 times in the worst
case---which may be exploitable as a denial-of-service vector on
untrusted input. This does not affect entries without a data descriptor,
and is not needed when *removed* is provided.

*chunk_size* may be specified to control the buffer size when moving
entry data (default is 1 MiB).

Calling `repack` on a closed ZipFile will
raise a `ValueError`.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The scanning algorithm is heuristic-based and assumes that the ZIP file
is normally structured---for example, with local file entries stored
consecutively, without overlap or interleaved binary data. Prepended
binary data, such as a self-extractor stub, is recognized and preserved
unless it happens to contain bytes that coincidentally resemble a valid
local file entry in multiple respects---an extremely rare case. Embedded
ZIP payloads are also handled correctly, as long as they follow normal
structure. However, the algorithm does not guarantee correctness or
safety on untrusted or intentionally crafted input. It is generally
recommended to provide the *removed* argument for better reliability and
performance.

::::::

The following data attributes are also available:

::: attribute
ZipFile.filename

Name of the ZIP file.
:::

::: attribute
ZipFile.debug

The level of debug output to use. This may be set from `0` (the default,
no output) to `3` (the most output). Debugging information is written to
`sys.stdout`.
:::

::: attribute
ZipFile.comment

The comment associated with the ZIP file as a `bytes` object. If assigning a comment to a
`ZipFile` instance created with mode
`'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'`, it should be no longer than 65535 bytes. Comments
longer than this will be truncated.
:::

## Path objects

::::: {.Path(root, .at='')}
Construct a Path object from a `root` zipfile (which may be a
`ZipFile` instance or `file` suitable
for passing to the `ZipFile`
constructor).

`at` specifies the location of this Path within the zipfile, e.g.
\'dir/file.txt\', \'dir/\', or \'\'. Defaults to the empty string,
indicating the root.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Path` class does not sanitize
filenames within the ZIP archive. Unlike the
`ZipFile.extract` and
`ZipFile.extractall` methods, it is the
caller\'s responsibility to validate or sanitize filenames to prevent
path traversal vulnerabilities (for example, absolute paths or paths
with \"..\" components). When handling untrusted archives, consider
resolving filenames using `os.path.abspath` and checking against the target directory with
`os.path.commonpath`.
::::
:::::

Path objects expose the following features of
`pathlib.Path` objects:

Path objects are traversable using the `/` operator or `joinpath`.

::: attribute
Path.name

The final path component.
:::

::::: method
Path.open(mode=\'r\', *, pwd,*\*)

Invoke `ZipFile.open` on the current
path. Allows opening for read or write, text or binary through supported
modes: \'r\', \'w\', \'rb\', \'wb\'. Positional and keyword arguments
are passed through to `io.TextIOWrapper`
when opened as text and ignored otherwise. `pwd` is the `pwd` parameter
to `ZipFile.open`.

::: versionchanged
3.9 Added support for text and binary modes for open. Default mode is
now text.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.11.2 The `encoding` parameter can be supplied as a positional argument
without causing a `TypeError`. As it could
in 3.9. Code needing to be compatible with unpatched 3.10 and 3.11
versions must pass all `io.TextIOWrapper` arguments, `encoding` included, as keywords.

:::: method
Path.read_text(*,*\*)

Read the current file as unicode text. Positional and keyword arguments
are passed through to `io.TextIOWrapper`
(except `buffer`, which is implied by the context).

::: versionchanged
3.11.2 The `encoding` parameter can be supplied as a positional argument
without causing a `TypeError`. As it could
in 3.9. Code needing to be compatible with unpatched 3.10 and 3.11
versions must pass all `io.TextIOWrapper` arguments, `encoding` included, as keywords.

::: method
Path.read_bytes()

Read the current file as bytes.
:::

:::: method
Path.joinpath(\*other)

Return a new Path object with each of the *other* arguments joined. The
following are equivalent:

    >>> Path(...).joinpath('child').joinpath('grandchild')
    >>> Path(...).joinpath('child', 'grandchild')
    >>> Path(...) / 'child' / 'grandchild'

::: versionchanged
3.10 Prior to 3.10, `joinpath` was undocumented and accepted exactly one
parameter.

The `zipp` project provides backports of
the latest path object functionality to older Pythons. Use `zipp.Path`
in place of `zipfile.Path` for early access to changes.

## PyZipFile objects

The `PyZipFile` constructor takes the
same parameters as the `ZipFile`
constructor, and one additional parameter, *optimize*.

::::::::: {.PyZipFile(file, .mode='r', .compression=ZIP_STORED, .allowZip64=True, .\\ .optimize=-1)}
::: versionchanged
3.2 Added the *optimize* parameter.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.4 ZIP64 extensions are enabled by default.
:::

Instances have one method in addition to those of
`ZipFile` objects:

:::::: method
PyZipFile.writepy(pathname, basename=\'\', filterfunc=None)

Search for files `\*.py` and add the
corresponding file to the archive.

If the *optimize* parameter to `PyZipFile` was not given or `-1`, the corresponding file is a
`\*.pyc` file, compiling if necessary.

If the *optimize* parameter to `PyZipFile` was `0`, `1` or `2`, only files with that optimization
level (see `compile`) are added to the
archive, compiling if necessary.

If *pathname* is a file, the filename must end with
`.py`, and just the (corresponding
`\*.pyc`) file is added at the top level
(no path information). If *pathname* is a file that does not end with
`.py`, a `RuntimeError` will be raised. If it is a directory, and the directory is
not a package directory, then all the files `\*.pyc` are added at the top level. If the directory is a package
directory, then all `\*.pyc` are added
under the package name as a file path, and if any subdirectories are
package directories, all of these are added recursively in sorted order.

*basename* is intended for internal use only.

*filterfunc*, if given, must be a function taking a single string
argument. It will be passed each path (including each individual full
file path) before it is added to the archive. If *filterfunc* returns a
false value, the path will not be added, and if it is a directory its
contents will be ignored. For example, if our test files are all either
in `test` directories or start with the string `test_`, we can use a
*filterfunc* to exclude them:

    >>> zf = PyZipFile('myprog.zip')
    >>> def notests(s):
    ...     fn = os.path.basename(s)
    ...     return (not (fn == 'test' or fn.startswith('test_')))
    ...
    >>> zf.writepy('myprog', filterfunc=notests)

The `writepy` method makes archives with
file names like this:

    string.pyc                   # Top level name
    test/__init__.pyc            # Package directory
    test/testall.pyc             # Module test.testall
    test/bogus/__init__.pyc      # Subpackage directory
    test/bogus/myfile.pyc        # Submodule test.bogus.myfile

::: versionchanged
3.4 Added the *filterfunc* parameter.

## ZipInfo objects

Instances of the `ZipInfo` class are
returned by the `.getinfo` and
`.infolist` methods of
`ZipFile` objects. Each object stores
information about a single member of the ZIP archive.

There is one classmethod to make a `ZipInfo` instance for a filesystem file:

:::::: classmethod
ZipInfo.from_file(filename, arcname=None, \*, strict_timestamps=True)

Construct a `ZipInfo` instance for a
file on the filesystem, in preparation for adding it to a zip file.

*filename* should be the path to a file or directory on the filesystem.

If *arcname* is specified, it is used as the name within the archive. If
*arcname* is not specified, the name will be the same as *filename*, but
with any drive letter and leading path separators removed.

The *strict_timestamps* argument, when set to `False`, allows to zip
files older than 1980-01-01 at the cost of setting the timestamp to
1980-01-01. Similar behavior occurs with files newer than 2107-12-31,
the timestamp is also set to the limit.

::: versionadded
3.6
:::

::: versionchanged
3.6.2 The *filename* parameter accepts a
`path-like object`.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.8 Added the *strict_timestamps* keyword-only parameter.
:::
::::::

Instances have the following methods and attributes:

:::: method
ZipInfo.is_dir()

Return `True` if this archive member is a directory.

This uses the entry\'s name: directories should always end with `/`.

::: versionadded
3.6
:::
::::

::: attribute
ZipInfo.filename

Name of the file in the archive.
:::

::::: attribute
ZipInfo.date_time

The time and date of the last modification to the archive member. This
is a tuple of six values representing the \"last \[modified\] file
time\" and \"last \[modified\] file date\" fields from the ZIP file\'s
central directory.

The tuple contains:

  Index   Value
  ------- --------------------------
  `0`     Year (\>= 1980)

  `1`     Month (one-based)

  `2`     Day of month (one-based)

  `3`     Hours (zero-based)

  `4`     Minutes (zero-based)

  `5`     Seconds (zero-based)

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The ZIP format supports multiple timestamp fields in different locations
(central directory, extra fields for NTFS/UNIX systems, etc.). This
attribute specifically returns the timestamp from the central directory.
The central directory timestamp format in ZIP files does not support
timestamps before 1980. While some extra field formats (such as UNIX
timestamps) can represent earlier dates, this attribute only returns the
central directory timestamp.

The central directory timestamp is interpreted as representing local
time, rather than UTC time, to match the behavior of other zip tools.

## Command-line interface

The `!zipfile` module provides a simple
command-line interface to interact with ZIP archives.

If you want to create a new ZIP archive, specify its name after the
`-c` option and then list the
filename(s) that should be included:

``` shell-session
$ python -m zipfile -c monty.zip spam.txt eggs.txt
```

Passing a directory is also acceptable:

``` shell-session
$ python -m zipfile -c monty.zip life-of-brian_1979/
```

If you want to extract a ZIP archive into the specified directory, use
the `-e` option:

``` shell-session
$ python -m zipfile -e monty.zip target-dir/
```

For a list of the files in a ZIP archive, use the `-l` option:

``` shell-session
$ python -m zipfile -l monty.zip
```

### Command-line options

::: option

`-l <zipfile>`

:

`--list <zipfile>`

:

List files in a zipfile.
:::

::: option
-c \<zipfile\> \<source1\> \... \<sourceN\> \--create \<zipfile\>
\<source1\> \... \<sourceN\>

Create zipfile from source files.
:::

::: option
-e \<zipfile\> \<output_dir\> \--extract \<zipfile\> \<output_dir\>

Extract zipfile into target directory.
:::

::: option

`-t <zipfile>`

:

`--test <zipfile>`

:

Test whether the zipfile is valid or not.
:::

:::: option

`--metadata-encoding <encoding>`

:

Specify encoding of member names for `-l`, `-e` and
`-t`.

## Decompression pitfalls

The extraction in zipfile module might fail due to some pitfalls listed
below.

### From file itself

Decompression may fail due to incorrect password / CRC checksum / ZIP
format or unsupported compression method / decryption.

### File system limitations

Exceeding limitations on different file systems can cause decompression
failed. Such as allowable characters in the directory entries, length of
the file name, length of the pathname, size of a single file, and number
of files, etc.

### Resources limitations {#zipfile-resources-limitations}

The lack of memory or disk volume would lead to decompression failed.
For example, decompression bombs (aka [ZIP
bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb)) apply to zipfile library
that can cause disk volume exhaustion.

### Interruption

Interruption during the decompression, such as pressing control-C or
killing the decompression process may result in incomplete decompression
of the archive.

### Default behaviors of extraction

Not knowing the default extraction behaviors can cause unexpected
decompression results. For example, when extracting the same archive
twice, it overwrites files without asking.
