# `!site` \-\-- Site-specific configuration hook

::: {.module synopsis="Module responsible for site-specific configuration."}
site
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/site.py`

**This module is automatically imported during initialization.** The
automatic import can be suppressed using the interpreter\'s
`-S` option.

Importing this module normally appends site-specific paths to the module
search path and adds `callables <site-consts>`, including `help` to the
built-in namespace. However, Python startup option
`-S` blocks this, and this module can
be safely imported with no automatic modifications to the module search
path or additions to the builtins. To explicitly trigger the usual
site-specific additions, call the `main`
function.

::: versionchanged
3.3 Importing the module used to trigger paths manipulation even when
using `-S`.
:::

It starts by constructing up to four directories from a head and a tail
part. For the head part, it uses `sys.prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix`;
empty heads are skipped. For the tail part, it uses the empty string and
then `lib/site-packages` (on Windows) or
`lib/python{X.Y[t]}/site-packages` (on
Unix and macOS). (The optional suffix \"t\" indicates the
`free-threaded build`, and is appended if
`"t"` is present in the `sys.abiflags`
constant.) For each of the distinct head-tail combinations, it sees if
it refers to an existing directory, and if so, adds it to `sys.path` and
also inspects the newly added path for configuration files.

::: versionchanged
3.5 Support for the \"site-python\" directory has been removed.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.13 On Unix, `Free threading <free threading>` Python installations are identified by the \"t\" suffix in
the version-specific directory name, such as
`lib/python3.13t/`.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.14

`!site` is no longer responsible for
updating `sys.prefix` and
`sys.exec_prefix` on
`sys-path-init-virtual-environments`. This
is now done during the
`path initialization <sys-path-init>`. As
a result, under `sys-path-init-virtual-environments`, `sys.prefix` and
`sys.exec_prefix` no longer depend on the
`!site` initialization, and are therefore
unaffected by `-S`.
:::

::: {#site-virtual-environments-configuration}
When running under a
`virtual environment <sys-path-init-virtual-environments>`, the `pyvenv.cfg` file in `sys.prefix` is checked for site-specific configurations. If the
`include-system-site-packages` key exists and is set to `true`
(case-insensitive), the system-level prefixes will be searched for
site-packages, otherwise they won\'t. If the system-level prefixes are
not searched then the user site prefixes are also implicitly not
searched for site-packages.
:::

The `!site` module recognizes two startup
configuration files of the form `{name}.pth` for path configurations, and
`{name}.start` for pre-first-line code
execution. Both files can exist in one of the four directories mentioned
above. Within each directory, these files are sorted alphabetically by
filename, then parsed in sorted order.

## Path extensions (`.pth` files) {#site-pth-files}

`{name}.pth` contains additional items
(one per line) to be appended to `sys.path`. Items that name
non-existing directories are never added to `sys.path`, and no check is
made that the item refers to a directory rather than a file. No item is
added to `sys.path` more than once. Blank lines and lines beginning with
`#` are skipped.

For backward compatibility, lines starting with `import` (followed by
space or tab) are executed with `exec`.

::: versionchanged
3.13

The `.pth` files are now decoded by UTF-8
at first and then by the `locale encoding` if it fails.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.15

`.pth` file lines starting with `import`
are deprecated. During the deprecation period, such lines are still
executed (except in the case below), but a diagnostic message is emitted
only when the `-v` flag is given.

`import` lines in `.pth`{.interpreted-text role="file"} are
silently ignored when a `matching <site-start-files>` `{name}.start` file exists.

Errors on individual lines no longer abort processing of the rest of the
file. Each error is reported and the remaining lines continue to be
processed.
:::

::: deprecated-removed
3.15 3.20

Decoding `{name}.pth` files in any
encoding other than `utf-8-sig` is deprecated in Python 3.15, and
support for decoding from the locale encoding will be removed in Python
3.20.

`import` lines in `.pth`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files are
deprecated and will be silently ignored in Python 3.18 and 3.19. In
Python 3.20 a warning will be produced for `import` lines in
`.pth`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files.
:::

## Startup entry points (`.start` files) {#site-start-files}

::: versionadded
3.15
:::

A startup entry point file is a file whose name has the form
`{name}.start` and exists in one of the
site-packages directories described above. Each file specifies entry
points to be called during interpreter startup, using the
`pkg.mod:callable` syntax understood by
`pkgutil.resolve_name`.

Each non-blank line that does not begin with `#` must contain an entry
point reference in the form `pkg.mod:callable`. The colon and callable
portion are mandatory. Each callable is invoked with no arguments, and
any return value is discarded.

`.start` files are processed after all
`.pth` path extensions have been applied
to `sys.path`, ensuring that paths are
available before any startup code runs.

Unlike `sys.path` extensions from
`.pth` files, duplicate entry points are
**not** de-duplicated \-\-- if an entry point appears more than once, it
will be called more than once.

If an exception occurs during resolution or invocation of an entry
point, a traceback is printed to `sys.stderr` and processing continues with the remaining entry points.

`.start` files must be encoded in UTF-8.

`829` defined the original specification
for these features.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a `{name}.start` file exists alongside
a `{name}.pth` file with the same base
name, any `import` lines in the `.pth`
file are ignored in favor of the entry points in the
`.start` file.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

Executable lines (`import` lines in `.pth`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} files and `.start`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
file entry points) are always run at Python startup (unless
`-S` is given to disable the `site.py`
module entirely), regardless of whether a particular module is actually
going to be used.
::::

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`.start`{.interpreted-text role="file"} files invoke
`pkgutil.resolve_name` with
`strict=True`, which requires the full `pkg.mod:callable` form.

## Startup file examples

For example, suppose `sys.prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix` are set to
`/usr/local`. The Python X.Y library is
then installed in `/usr/local/lib/python{X.Y}`. Suppose this has a subdirectory
`/usr/local/lib/python{X.Y}/site-packages` with three sub-subdirectories, `foo`, `bar` and
`spam`, and two path configuration files,
`foo.pth` and `bar.pth`. Assume `foo.pth` contains
the following:

``` none
# foo package configuration

foo
bar
bletch
```

and `bar.pth` contains:

``` none
# bar package configuration

bar
```

Then the following version-specific directories are added to `sys.path`,
in this order:

``` none
/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/bar
/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/foo
```

Note that `bletch` is omitted because it
doesn\'t exist; the `bar` directory
precedes the `foo` directory because
`bar.pth` comes alphabetically before
`foo.pth`; and `spam` is omitted because it is not mentioned in either path
configuration file.

Let\'s say that there is also a `foo.start` file containing the following:

``` none
# foo package startup code

foo.submod:initialize
```

Now, after `sys.path` has been extended as above, and before Python
turns control over to user code, the `foo.submod` module is imported and
the `initialize()` function from that module is called.

## Migrating from `import` lines in `.pth` files to `.start` files {#site-migration-guide}

If your package currently ships a `.pth`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} file, you can keep all `sys.path` extension lines
unchanged. Only `import` lines need to be migrated.

To migrate, create a callable (taking zero arguments) within an
importable module in your package. Reference it as a `pkg.mod:callable`
entry point in a matching `.start`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
file. Move everything on your `import` line after the first semi-colon
into the `callable()` function.

If your package must straddle older Pythons that do not support
`829` and newer Pythons that do, change
the `import` lines in your `.pth`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
to use the following form:

``` python
import pkg.mod; pkg.mod.callable()
```

Older Pythons will execute these `import` lines, while newer Pythons
will ignore them in favor of the `.start`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} file. After the straddling period, remove all `import`
lines from your `.pth` files.

## `!sitecustomize`

::: module
sitecustomize
:::

After these path manipulations, an attempt is made to import a module
named `!sitecustomize`, which can perform
arbitrary site-specific customizations. It is typically created by a
system administrator in the site-packages directory. If this import
fails with an `ImportError` or its
subclass exception, and the exception\'s
`~ImportError.name` attribute equals
`'sitecustomize'`, it is silently ignored. If Python is started without
output streams available, as with `pythonw.exe` on Windows (which is used by default to start IDLE),
attempted output from `!sitecustomize` is
ignored. Any other exception causes a silent and perhaps mysterious
failure of the process.

## `!usercustomize`

::: module
usercustomize
:::

After this, an attempt is made to import a module named
`!usercustomize`, which can perform
arbitrary user-specific customizations, if
`~site.ENABLE_USER_SITE` is true. This
file is intended to be created in the user site-packages directory (see
below), which is part of `sys.path` unless disabled by
`-s`. If this import fails with an
`ImportError` or its subclass exception,
and the exception\'s `~ImportError.name`
attribute equals `'usercustomize'`, it is silently ignored.

Note that for some non-Unix systems, `sys.prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix`
are empty, and the path manipulations are skipped; however the import of
`sitecustomize` and
`!usercustomize` is still attempted.

## Readline configuration {#rlcompleter-config}

On systems that support `readline`, this
module will also import and configure the
`rlcompleter` module, if Python is started
in `interactive mode <tut-interactive>`
and without the `-S` option. The
default behavior is to enable tab completion and to use
`~/.python_history` as the history save
file. To disable it, delete (or override) the
`sys.__interactivehook__` attribute in
your `sitecustomize` or
`usercustomize` module or your
`PYTHONSTARTUP` file.

::: versionchanged
3.4 Activation of rlcompleter and history was made automatic.

## Module contents

::: data
PREFIXES

A list of prefixes for site-packages directories.
:::

::: data
ENABLE_USER_SITE

Flag showing the status of the user site-packages directory. `True`
means that it is enabled and was added to `sys.path`. `False` means that
it was disabled by user request (with `-s` or `PYTHONNOUSERSITE`).
`None` means it was disabled for security reasons (mismatch between user
or group id and effective id) or by an administrator.
:::

::: data
USER_SITE

Path to the user site-packages for the running Python. Can be `None` if
`getusersitepackages` hasn\'t been called
yet. Default value is
`~/.local/lib/python{X.Y}[t]/site-packages` for UNIX and non-framework macOS builds,
`~/Library/Python/{X.Y}/lib/python/site-packages` for macOS framework builds, and
`{%APPDATA%}\\Python\\Python{XY}\\site-packages` on Windows. The optional \"t\" indicates the free-threaded
build. This directory is a site directory, which means that
`.pth` files in it will be processed.
:::

::: data
USER_BASE

Path to the base directory for the user site-packages. Can be `None` if
`getuserbase` hasn\'t been called yet.
Default value is `~/.local` for UNIX and
macOS non-framework builds, `~/Library/Python/{X.Y}` for macOS framework builds, and
`{%APPDATA%}\\Python` for Windows. This
value is used to compute the installation directories for scripts, data
files, Python modules, etc. for the
`user installation scheme <sysconfig-user-scheme>`. See also `PYTHONUSERBASE`.
:::

:::: function
main()

Adds all the standard site-specific directories to the module search
path. This function is called automatically when this module is
imported, unless the Python interpreter was started with the
`-S` flag.

::: versionchanged
3.3 This function used to be called unconditionally.
:::
::::

::: function
makepath(\*paths)

Join *paths* with `os.path.join`, attempt
to make the result absolute with `os.path.abspath`, and return a 2-tuple containing the absolute path and its
case-normalized form as produced by `os.path.normcase`. If `os.path.abspath` raises
`OSError`, the joined path is used
unchanged for the case-normalization step.

The second element of the returned tuple is the form used throughout the
`!site` module to compare paths on
case-insensitive file systems, and is what populates the `known_paths`
sets that prevent duplicate `sys.path`
entries in various APIs within this module.
:::

:::::::: StartupState(known_paths=None)
Instances of this class accumulate interpreter startup configuration
data from one or more site directories. They are the preferred interface
for batching the processing of `.pth` and
`.start` files across multiple site
directories, so that every `sys.path`
extension is visible before any startup code runs.

The optional *known_paths* argument is a set of case-normalized paths
(which can be produced by `makepath`)
used to prevent duplicate `sys.path`
entries. When `None` (the default), the set is built from the current
`sys.path`. `main` implicitly uses an instance of this class.

Typical use:

``` python
state = site.StartupState()
for sitedir in site_dirs:
    state.addsitedir(sitedir)
state.process()
```

::: versionadded
3.15
:::

::: method
addsitedir(sitedir)

Read the `.pth` and
`.start` files in *sitedir* and record
their `sys.path` extensions, deprecated
`.pth` `import` lines, and
`.start` entry points on this state. The
recorded data is not applied until `process` is called.
:::

::: method
addusersitepackages()

Add the per-user site-packages directory, if enabled and if it exists.
The directory\'s startup data is accumulated for later processing by
`process`.
:::

::: method
addsitepackages(prefixes=None)

Add global site-packages directories, computed from *prefixes* or from
the global `PREFIXES` when *prefixes* is
`None`. Each directory\'s startup data is accumulated for later
processing by `process`.
:::

::: method
process()

Apply the accumulated state by first adding the path extensions to
`sys.path`, then executing the
`.start` file entry points and
`.pth` file `import` lines (`deprecated
<site-pth-files>`).

This method is not idempotent and must not be called more than once on
the same instance. Doing so will apply the accumulated state more than
once, re-running entry points and `import` lines.
:::
::::::::

:::: function
addsitedir(sitedir, known_paths=None)

Add a directory to sys.path and parse the `.pth` and `.start` files found in
that directory. Typically used in `sitecustomize` or `usercustomize` (see
above).

The *known_paths* argument is an optional set of case-normalized paths
used to prevent duplicate `sys.path`
entries. When `None` (the default), the set is built from the current
`sys.path`.

For batched processing across multiple site directories, build a
`StartupState` explicitly and call
`StartupState.addsitedir` on it; that
defers `.pth` and
`.start` processing until a single
`StartupState.process` call, ensuring
every `sys.path` extension is visible
before any startup code runs.

::: versionchanged
3.15

Also processes `.start` files. See
`site-start-files`.
:::
::::

:::: function
getsitepackages()

Return a list containing all global site-packages directories.

::: versionadded
3.2

::::

:::: function
getuserbase()

Return the path of the user base directory,
`USER_BASE`. If it is not initialized
yet, this function will also set it, respecting
`PYTHONUSERBASE`.

::: versionadded
3.2
:::
::::

:::: function
getusersitepackages()

Return the path of the user-specific site-packages directory,
`USER_SITE`. If it is not initialized
yet, this function will also set it, respecting
`USER_BASE`. To determine if the
user-specific site-packages was added to `sys.path`
`ENABLE_USER_SITE` should be used.

## Command-line interface {#site-commandline}

::: program
site
:::

The `!site` module also provides a way to
get the user directories from the command line:

``` shell-session
$ python -m site --user-site
/home/user/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
```

If it is called without arguments, it will print the contents of
`sys.path` on the standard output,
followed by the value of `USER_BASE` and
whether the directory exists, then the same thing for
`USER_SITE`, and finally the value of
`ENABLE_USER_SITE`.

::: option

`--user-base`

:

Print the path to the user base directory.
:::

::: option

`--user-site`

:

Print the path to the user site-packages directory.
:::

If both options are given, user base and user site will be printed
(always in this order), separated by `os.pathsep`.

If any option is given, the script will exit with one of these values:
`0` if the user site-packages directory is enabled, `1` if it was
disabled by the user, `2` if it is disabled for security reasons or by
an administrator, and a value greater than 2 if there is an error.
