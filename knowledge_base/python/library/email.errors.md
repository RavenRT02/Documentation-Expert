# `!email.errors`: Exception and Defect classes

::: {.module synopsis="The exception classes used by the email package."}
email.errors
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/email/errors.py`

The following exception classes are defined in the
`!email.errors` module:

::: exception
MessageError()

This is the base class for all exceptions that the
`email` package can raise. It is derived
from the standard `Exception` class and
defines no additional methods.
:::

::: exception
MessageParseError()

This is the base class for exceptions raised by the
`~email.parser.Parser` class. It is
derived from `MessageError`. This class is
also used internally by the parser used by
`~email.headerregistry`.
:::

::: exception
HeaderParseError()

Raised under some error conditions when parsing the
`5322` headers of a message, this class is
derived from `MessageParseError`. The
`~email.message.EmailMessage.set_boundary` method will raise this error if the content type is unknown
when the method is called. `~email.header.Header` may raise this error for certain base64 decoding errors,
and when an attempt is made to create a header that appears to contain
an embedded header (that is, there is what is supposed to be a
continuation line that has no leading whitespace and looks like a
header).
:::

::: exception
BoundaryError()

Deprecated and no longer used.
:::

::: exception
MultipartConversionError()

Raised if the `~email.message.Message.attach` method is called on an instance of a class derived from
`~email.mime.nonmultipart.MIMENonMultipart` (e.g. `~email.mime.image.MIMEImage`). `MultipartConversionError`
multiply inherits from `MessageError` and
the built-in `TypeError`.
:::

::: exception
HeaderWriteError()

Raised when an error occurs when the
`~email.generator` outputs headers.
:::

::: exception
MessageDefect()

This is the base class for all defects found when parsing email
messages. It is derived from `ValueError`.
:::

::: exception
HeaderDefect()

This is the base class for all defects found when parsing email headers.
It is derived from `MessageDefect`.
:::

Here is the list of the defects that the
`~email.parser.FeedParser` can find
while parsing messages. Note that the defects are added to the message
where the problem was found, so for example, if a message nested inside
a `multipart/alternative` had a
malformed header, that nested message object would have a defect, but
the containing messages would not.

All defect classes are subclassed from
`email.errors.MessageDefect`.

::: exception
NoBoundaryInMultipartDefect

A message claimed to be a multipart, but had no
`boundary` parameter.
:::

::: exception
StartBoundaryNotFoundDefect

The start boundary claimed in the `Content-Type` header was never found.
:::

:::: exception
CloseBoundaryNotFoundDefect

A start boundary was found, but no corresponding close boundary was ever
found.

::: versionadded
3.3
:::
::::

::: exception
FirstHeaderLineIsContinuationDefect

The message had a continuation line as its first header line.
:::

::: exception
MisplacedEnvelopeHeaderDefect

A \"Unix From\" header was found in the middle of a header block.
:::

:::: exception
MissingHeaderBodySeparatorDefect

A line was found while parsing headers that had no leading white space
but contained no \':\'. Parsing continues assuming that the line
represents the first line of the body.

::: versionadded
3.3
:::
::::

:::: exception
MalformedHeaderDefect

A header was found that was missing a colon, or was otherwise malformed.

::: deprecated
3.3 This defect has not been used for several Python versions.
:::
::::

::: exception
MultipartInvariantViolationDefect

A message claimed to be a `multipart`, but no subparts were found. Note that when a message
has this defect, its
`~email.message.Message.is_multipart`
method may return `False` even though its content type claims to be
`multipart`.
:::

::: exception
InvalidBase64PaddingDefect

When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the padding was not
correct. Enough padding is added to perform the decode, but the
resulting decoded bytes may be invalid.
:::

::: exception
InvalidBase64CharactersDefect

When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, characters outside the
base64 alphabet were encountered. The characters are ignored, but the
resulting decoded bytes may be invalid.
:::

::: exception
InvalidBase64LengthDefect

When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the number of non-padding
base64 characters was invalid (1 more than a multiple of 4). The encoded
block was kept as-is.
:::

::: exception
InvalidDateDefect

When decoding an invalid or unparsable date field. The original value is
kept as-is.
