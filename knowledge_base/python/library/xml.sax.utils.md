**Source code:** `Lib/xml/sax/saxutils.py`

The module `!xml.sax.saxutils` contains a
number of classes and functions that are commonly useful when creating
SAX applications, either in direct use, or as base classes.

::::: function
escape(data, entities={})

Escape `'&'`, `'<'`, and `'>'` in a string of data.

You can escape other strings of data by passing a dictionary as the
optional *entities* parameter. The keys and values must all be strings;
each key will be replaced with its corresponding value. The characters
`'&'`, `'<'` and `'>'` are always escaped, even if *entities* is
provided.

::: title
Note
:::

This function should only be used to escape characters that can\'t be
used directly in XML. Do not use this function as a general string
translation function.

:::::

::: function
unescape(data, entities={})

Unescape `'&amp;'`, `'&lt;'`, and `'&gt;'` in a string of data.

You can unescape other strings of data by passing a dictionary as the
optional *entities* parameter. The keys and values must all be strings;
each key will be replaced with its corresponding value. `'&amp;'`,
`'&lt;'`, and `'&gt;'` are always unescaped, even if *entities* is
provided.
:::

::: function
quoteattr(data, entities={})

Similar to `escape`, but also prepares
*data* to be used as an attribute value. The return value is a quoted
version of *data* with any additional required replacements.
`quoteattr` will select a quote character
based on the content of *data*, attempting to avoid encoding any quote
characters in the string. If both single- and double-quote characters
are already in *data*, the double-quote characters will be encoded and
*data* will be wrapped in double-quotes. The resulting string can be
used directly as an attribute value:

    >>> print("<element attr=%s>" % quoteattr("ab ' cd \" ef"))
    <element attr="ab ' cd &quot; ef">

This function is useful when generating attribute values for HTML or any
SGML using the reference concrete syntax.

:::: {.XMLGenerator(out=None, .encoding='iso-8859-1', .short_empty_elements=False)}
This class implements the
`~xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler`
interface by writing SAX events back into an XML document. In other
words, using an `XMLGenerator` as the
content handler will reproduce the original document being parsed. *out*
should be a file-like object which will default to *sys.stdout*.
*encoding* is the encoding of the output stream which defaults to
`'iso-8859-1'`. *short_empty_elements* controls the formatting of
elements that contain no content: if `False` (the default) they are
emitted as a pair of start/end tags, if set to `True` they are emitted
as a single self-closed tag.

::: versionchanged
3.2 Added the *short_empty_elements* parameter.

::::

::: XMLFilterBase(base)
This class is designed to sit between an
`~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader` and the
client application\'s event handlers. By default, it does nothing but
pass requests up to the reader and events on to the handlers unmodified,
but subclasses can override specific methods to modify the event stream
or the configuration requests as they pass through.
:::

::: function
prepare_input_source(source, base=\'\')

This function takes an input source and an optional base URL and returns
a fully resolved `~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource` object ready for reading. The input source can be given as
a string, a file-like object, or an
`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource` object;
parsers will use this function to implement the polymorphic *source*
argument to their `~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader.parse` method.
