# `!xml.sax.xmlreader` \-\-- Interface for XML parsers

::: {.module synopsis="Interface which SAX-compliant XML parsers must implement."}
xml.sax.xmlreader
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/xml/sax/xmlreader.py`

SAX parsers implement the `XMLReader`
interface. They are implemented in a Python module, which must provide a
function `create_parser`. This function
is invoked by `xml.sax.make_parser` with
no arguments to create a new parser object.

::: XMLReader()
Base class which can be inherited by SAX parsers.
:::

::: IncrementalParser()
In some cases, it is desirable not to parse an input source at once, but
to feed chunks of the document as they get available. Note that the
reader will normally not read the entire file, but read it in chunks as
well; still `parse` won\'t return until
the entire document is processed. So these interfaces should be used if
the blocking behaviour of `parse` is not
desirable.

When the parser is instantiated it is ready to begin accepting data from
the feed method immediately. After parsing has been finished with a call
to close the reset method must be called to make the parser ready to
accept new data, either from feed or using the parse method.

Note that these methods must *not* be called during parsing, that is,
after parse has been called and before it returns.

By default, the class also implements the parse method of the XMLReader
interface using the feed, close and reset methods of the
IncrementalParser interface as a convenience to SAX 2.0 driver writers.
:::

::: Locator()
Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location. A
locator object will return valid results only during calls to
DocumentHandler methods; at any other time, the results are
unpredictable. If information is not available, methods may return
`None`.
:::

::: InputSource(system_id=None)
Encapsulation of the information needed by the
`XMLReader` to read entities.

This class may include information about the public identifier, system
identifier, byte stream (possibly with character encoding information)
and/or the character stream of an entity.

Applications will create objects of this class for use in the
`XMLReader.parse` method and for
returning from EntityResolver.resolveEntity.

An `InputSource` belongs to the
application, the `XMLReader` is not
allowed to modify `InputSource` objects
passed to it from the application, although it may make copies and
modify those.
:::

::: AttributesImpl(attrs)
This is an implementation of the `Attributes` interface (see section
`attributes-objects`). This is a
dictionary-like object which represents the element attributes in a
`startElement` call. In addition to the
most useful dictionary operations, it supports a number of other methods
as described by the interface. Objects of this class should be
instantiated by readers; *attrs* must be a dictionary-like object
containing a mapping from attribute names to attribute values.
:::

::: {.AttributesNSImpl(attrs, .qnames)}
Namespace-aware variant of `AttributesImpl`, which will be passed to
`startElementNS`. It is derived from
`AttributesImpl`, but understands
attribute names as two-tuples of *namespaceURI* and *localname*. In
addition, it provides a number of methods expecting qualified names as
they appear in the original document. This class implements the
`AttributesNS` interface (see section
`attributes-ns-objects`).
:::

## XMLReader Objects

The `XMLReader` interface supports the
following methods:

::::: method
XMLReader.parse(source)

Process an input source, producing SAX events. The *source* object can
be a system identifier (a string identifying the input source \--
typically a file name or a URL), a `pathlib.Path` or `path-like <path-like object>` object, or an `InputSource`
object. When `parse` returns, the input
is completely processed, and the parser object can be discarded or
reset.

::: versionchanged
3.5 Added support of character streams.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.8 Added support of path-like objects.
:::
:::::

::: method
XMLReader.getContentHandler()

Return the current `~xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler`.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.setContentHandler(handler)

Set the current `~xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler`. If no `~xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler` is set, content events will be discarded.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.getDTDHandler()

Return the current `~xml.sax.handler.DTDHandler`.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.setDTDHandler(handler)

Set the current `~xml.sax.handler.DTDHandler`. If no `~xml.sax.handler.DTDHandler` is set, DTD events will be discarded.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.getEntityResolver()

Return the current `~xml.sax.handler.EntityResolver`.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.setEntityResolver(handler)

Set the current `~xml.sax.handler.EntityResolver`. If no `~xml.sax.handler.EntityResolver` is set, attempts to resolve an external entity will result
in opening the system identifier for the entity, and fail if it is not
available.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.getErrorHandler()

Return the current `~xml.sax.handler.ErrorHandler`.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.setErrorHandler(handler)

Set the current error handler. If no
`~xml.sax.handler.ErrorHandler` is set,
errors will be raised as exceptions, and warnings will be printed.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.setLocale(locale)

Allow an application to set the locale for errors and warnings.

SAX parsers are not required to provide localization for errors and
warnings; if they cannot support the requested locale, however, they
must raise a SAX exception. Applications may request a locale change in
the middle of a parse.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.getFeature(featurename)

Return the current setting for feature *featurename*. If the feature is
not recognized, `SAXNotRecognizedException` is raised. The well-known featurenames are listed in the
module `xml.sax.handler`.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.setFeature(featurename, value)

Set the *featurename* to *value*. If the feature is not recognized,
`SAXNotRecognizedException` is raised. If
the feature or its setting is not supported by the parser,
*SAXNotSupportedException* is raised.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.getProperty(propertyname)

Return the current setting for property *propertyname*. If the property
is not recognized, a `SAXNotRecognizedException` is raised. The well-known propertynames are listed in the
module `xml.sax.handler`.
:::

::: method
XMLReader.setProperty(propertyname, value)

Set the *propertyname* to *value*. If the property is not recognized,
`SAXNotRecognizedException` is raised. If
the property or its setting is not supported by the parser,
*SAXNotSupportedException* is raised.
:::

## IncrementalParser Objects {#incremental-parser-objects}

Instances of `IncrementalParser` offer
the following additional methods:

::: method
IncrementalParser.feed(data)

Process a chunk of *data*.
:::

::: method
IncrementalParser.close()

Assume the end of the document. That will check well-formedness
conditions that can be checked only at the end, invoke handlers, and may
clean up resources allocated during parsing.
:::

::: method
IncrementalParser.reset()

This method is called after close has been called to reset the parser so
that it is ready to parse new documents. The results of calling parse or
feed after close without calling reset are undefined.
:::

## Locator Objects

Instances of `Locator` provide these
methods:

::: method
Locator.getColumnNumber()

Return the column number where the current event begins.
:::

::: method
Locator.getLineNumber()

Return the line number where the current event begins.
:::

::: method
Locator.getPublicId()

Return the public identifier for the current event.
:::

::: method
Locator.getSystemId()

Return the system identifier for the current event.
:::

## InputSource Objects {#input-source-objects}

::: method
InputSource.setPublicId(id)

Sets the public identifier of this `InputSource`.
:::

::: method
InputSource.getPublicId()

Returns the public identifier of this `InputSource`.
:::

::: method
InputSource.setSystemId(id)

Sets the system identifier of this `InputSource`.
:::

::: method
InputSource.getSystemId()

Returns the system identifier of this `InputSource`.
:::

::: method
InputSource.setEncoding(encoding)

Sets the character encoding of this `InputSource`.

The encoding must be a string acceptable for an XML encoding declaration
(see section 4.3.3 of the XML recommendation).

The encoding attribute of the `InputSource` is ignored if the `InputSource` also contains a character stream.
:::

::: method
InputSource.getEncoding()

Get the character encoding of this InputSource.
:::

::: method
InputSource.setByteStream(bytefile)

Set the byte stream (a `binary file`) for
this input source.

The SAX parser will ignore this if there is also a character stream
specified, but it will use a byte stream in preference to opening a URI
connection itself.

If the application knows the character encoding of the byte stream, it
should set it with the setEncoding method.
:::

::: method
InputSource.getByteStream()

Get the byte stream for this input source.

The getEncoding method will return the character encoding for this byte
stream, or `None` if unknown.
:::

::: method
InputSource.setCharacterStream(charfile)

Set the character stream (a `text file`)
for this input source.

If there is a character stream specified, the SAX parser will ignore any
byte stream and will not attempt to open a URI connection to the system
identifier.
:::

::: method
InputSource.getCharacterStream()

Get the character stream for this input source.
:::

## The `Attributes` Interface {#attributes-objects}

`Attributes` objects implement a portion
of the `mapping protocol
<mapping>`, including the methods
`~collections.abc.Mapping.copy`,
`~collections.abc.Mapping.get`,
`~object.__contains__`,
`~collections.abc.Mapping.items`,
`~collections.abc.Mapping.keys`, and
`~collections.abc.Mapping.values`. The
following methods are also provided:

::: method
Attributes.getLength()

Return the number of attributes.
:::

::: method
Attributes.getNames()

Return the names of the attributes.
:::

::: method
Attributes.getType(name)

Returns the type of the attribute *name*, which is normally `'CDATA'`.
:::

::: method
Attributes.getValue(name)

Return the value of attribute *name*.
:::

## The `AttributesNS` Interface {#attributes-ns-objects}

This interface is a subtype of the `Attributes` interface (see section
`attributes-objects`). All methods
supported by that interface are also available on
`AttributesNS` objects.

The following methods are also available:

::: method
AttributesNS.getValueByQName(name)

Return the value for a qualified name.
:::

::: method
AttributesNS.getNameByQName(name)

Return the `(namespace, localname)` pair for a qualified *name*.
:::

::: method
AttributesNS.getQNameByName(name)

Return the qualified name for a `(namespace, localname)` pair.
:::

::: method
AttributesNS.getQNames()

Return the qualified names of all attributes.
:::
