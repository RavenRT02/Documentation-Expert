The `!tkinter.dnd` module provides
drag-and-drop support for objects within a single application, within
the same window or between windows. To enable an object to be dragged,
you must create an event binding for it that starts the drag-and-drop
process. Typically, you bind a ButtonPress event to a callback function
that you write (see `Bindings-and-Events`). The function should call `dnd_start`, where \'source\' is the object to be dragged, and
\'event\' is the event that invoked the call (the argument to your
callback function).

Selection of a target object occurs as follows:

1.  Top-down search of area under mouse for target widget

> - Target widget should have a callable *dnd_accept* attribute
> - If *dnd_accept* is not present or returns `None`, search moves to
>   parent widget
> - If no target widget is found, then the target object is `None`

2.  Call to *\<old_target\>.dnd_leave(source, event)*
3.  Call to *\<new_target\>.dnd_enter(source, event)*
4.  Call to *\<target\>.dnd_commit(source, event)* to notify of drop
5.  Call to *\<source\>.dnd_end(target, event)* to signal end of
    drag-and-drop

::::::: {.DndHandler(source, .event)}
The *DndHandler* class handles drag-and-drop events tracking Motion and
ButtonRelease events on the root of the event widget.

::: method
cancel(event=None)

Cancel the drag-and-drop process.
:::

::: method
finish(event, commit=0)

Execute end of drag-and-drop functions.
:::

::: method

:::

::: method

:::
:::::::

::: function
