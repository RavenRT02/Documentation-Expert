# `!netrc` \-\-- netrc file processing

netrc
:::

**Source code:** `Lib/netrc.py`

The `~netrc.netrc` class parses and
encapsulates the netrc file format used by the Unix
`ftp` program and other FTP clients.

:::::: netrc([file])
A `~netrc.netrc` instance or subclass
instance encapsulates data from a netrc file. The initialization
argument, if present, specifies the file to parse. If no argument is
given, the file `.netrc` in the user\'s
home directory \-- as determined by
`os.path.expanduser` \-- will be read.
Otherwise, a `FileNotFoundError` exception
will be raised. Parse errors will raise
`NetrcParseError` with diagnostic
information including the file name, line number, and terminating token.

If no argument is specified on a POSIX system, the presence of passwords
in the `.netrc` file will raise a
`NetrcParseError` if the file ownership or
permissions are insecure (owned by a user other than the user running
the process, or accessible for read or write by any other user). This
implements security behavior equivalent to that of ftp and other
programs that use `.netrc`. Such security
checks are not available on platforms that do not support
`os.getuid`.

::: versionchanged
3.4 Added the POSIX permission check.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.7 `os.path.expanduser` is used to find
the location of the `.netrc` file when
*file* is not passed as argument.
:::

::: versionchanged
3.10 `netrc` try UTF-8 encoding before
using locale specific encoding. The entry in the netrc file no longer
needs to contain all tokens. The missing tokens\' value default to an
empty string. All the tokens and their values now can contain arbitrary
characters, like whitespace and non-ASCII characters. If the login name
is anonymous, it won\'t trigger the security check.

:::::: exception
NetrcParseError

Exception raised by the `~netrc.netrc`
class when syntactical errors are encountered in source text. Instances
of this exception provide three interesting attributes:

::: attribute
msg

Textual explanation of the error.
:::

::: attribute
filename

The name of the source file.
:::

::: attribute
lineno

The line number on which the error was found.

## netrc Objects

A `~netrc.netrc` instance has the
following methods:

::: method
netrc.authenticators(host)

Return a 3-tuple `(login, account, password)` of authenticators for
*host*. If the netrc file did not contain an entry for the given host,
return the tuple associated with the \'default\' entry. If neither
matching host nor default entry is available, return `None`.
:::

::: method
netrc.\_\_repr\_\_()

Dump the class data as a string in the format of a netrc file. (This
discards comments and may reorder the entries.)
:::

Instances of `~netrc.netrc` have public
instance variables:

::: attribute
netrc.hosts

Dictionary mapping host names to `(login, account, password)` tuples.
The \'default\' entry, if any, is represented as a pseudo-host by that
name.
:::

::: attribute
netrc.macros

Dictionary mapping macro names to string lists.
